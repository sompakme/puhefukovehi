By Charlene Badasie | Updated 11 months ago After years of waiting, Hulu has finally released the first images from The Orville season three. The sci-fi comedy series will premiere on the streaming network after airing its previous two seasons on Fox.

The sci-fi comedy&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series</a>&nbsp;will premiere on the streaming network after airing its previous two seasons on Fox. The show’s move to <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=Hulu data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Hulu</a> was announced in 2019, but the new season was delayed multiple times due to filming complications associated with the ongoing global pandemic. The new photos give fans a look at old favorites in the cast and a trio of brand new characters.</p><p>The images were released exclusively to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Line</a>&nbsp;and shared on social media by the show’s executive producer Jon Cassar. The first photo reveals&nbsp;The Orville’s&nbsp;new bridge tech upgrade which will be featured throughout season three. The first photo sees Captain Ed Mercer (Seth MacFarlane), Commander Kelly Grayson (Adrianne Palicki), and Lt. Gordon Malloy (Scott Grimes) manning their usual posts, while Admiral Halsey (Victor Garber) observes.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The Orville’s three new cast members include new series regular Anne Winters (of&nbsp;13 Reasons Why&nbsp;fame) as Ensign Charly Burke – while Bruce Boxleitner (of&nbsp;Babylon 5) and the late Lisa Banes (of&nbsp;Royal Pains) guest-star as President Alcuzan and Senator Balask. The series also stars Penny Johnson Jerald, Peter Macon, J. Lee, Mark Jackson, Chad L. Coleman, Jessica Szohr, and the late Norm Macdonald who died earlier this year. Eliza Taylor (of&nbsp;The 100)&nbsp;is also set to appear in the show.</p><p>Unlike its previous offerings,&nbsp;The Orville&nbsp;season three will only feature 10 episodes. But the run time has been extended by an average of 15 minutes. The story follows the crew of the titular exploratory spaceship continuing their mission, as they navigate the mysteries of the universe and the complexities of their interpersonal relationships. Hulu also released a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">teaser trailer</a>&nbsp;earlier this year, featuring audio from the new season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">https://www.<a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=youtube data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>youtube</a>.com/watch?v=heMcSXRXm5Q</figure><p>Speaking about&nbsp;The Orville’s&nbsp;future, the head of scripted originals at Hulu, Jordan Helman told<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;Deadline</a>, that he hasn’t ruled out the possibility of a fourth season. He said the future of the show remains an open conversation and there have been no conversations otherwise. “I believe the fans of the show that are coming to us from Fox will be deeply excited and satiated,” he told the publication. “I also think for new fans that maybe didn’t experience it, it will feel new to them.”</p><p>Created by&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Seth MacFarlane</a>&nbsp;(who also stars as series protagonist Ed Mercer)&nbsp;The Orville&nbsp;is primarily inspired by the original&nbsp;Star Trek&nbsp;series and its successor&nbsp;Star Trek: Next Generation. The show essentially pays homage to and heavily parodies the cult classics, while following the crew of the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=starship data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>starship</a> USS Orville on their adventures.</p><p>The first season of&nbsp;The Orville&nbsp;received generally negative <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=reviews data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>reviews</a> from critics, while season two did slightly better. In terms of viewership, the show had relatively successful ratings, becoming the Fox network’s highest-rated Thursday show and most-viewed debut drama since 2015. Over the years the series has also featured some big-name guest stars like Liam Neeson, Bruce Willis, <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Charlize Theron" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Charlize Theron</a>, and Jason Alexander.</p><p>The Orville: New Horizons&nbsp;will premiere on March 10, 2022, with new episodes airing weekly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2inoqu2rbjEZqqemaOku25%2FjaGrpqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
