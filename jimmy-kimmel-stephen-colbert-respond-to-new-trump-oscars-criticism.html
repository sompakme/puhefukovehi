On Wednesday, the presumptive Republican nominee for president drew some attention away from his hush money trial, which is now in the jury selection process in Manhattan, with a post on his Truth Social platform in which he reignited a feud with Kimmel, who hosted the Oscar ceremony March 10, more than five weeks ago."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

All of this made ample fodder for Kimmel during his Jimmy Kimmel Live! monologue Wednesday.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“He’s not just wrong, but maybe, ‘We should be worried about him’ wrong. Like, ‘Maybe we should take the keys away from Grandpa’ wrong.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In addition to noting that Pacino presented the top award at the ceremony, Kimmel also pointed out that the ratings for this year’s Oscars ceremony went up this year. An average of 19.5 million viewers tuned in to watch, <a href=#>according to Nielsen data</a> — this is a 4 percent increase over the 18.8 million who tuned in for the 95th annual Academy Awards in 2023. This led Kimmel to hint at his potential next hosting gig.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I don’t know. That must be why they asked me to host the show again next year, which I wasn’t planning to do but now I might,” he added, then addressing Trump: “Maybe — you know what — maybe you can watch on the TV in the rec room at Rikers with all the guys.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Kimmel hasn’t officially signed on to host next year’s Oscars, <a href=#>and speaking to The Hollywood Reporter ahead of this year’s show</a> about a potential fifth time emceeing the ceremony, he said, “I would be very foolish to make that decision now, or really anytime before next September.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On The Late Show With <a href=# id=auto-tag_stephen-colbert data-tag=stephen-colbert>Stephen Colbert</a>, the host also got big laughs out of Trump’s post during his own opening monologue, in which he noted that the former president is dwelling on a feud from five weeks ago amid his presidential campaign while facing multiple indictments.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“In the category of outstanding achievement in syphilitic ramble in a social media post. The winner is …” Colbert joked, later adding: “I look forward to his new campaign slogan, ‘Trump 2024: They gave it to Green Book?’”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Colbert then defended his fellow late night host from Trump’s ongoing online ire.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Also, you keep my friend Jimmy Kimmel’s name out of your weird, little, wet mouth,” he said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Thursday is the third day of jury selection in Trump’s hush-money trial in Manhattan.
