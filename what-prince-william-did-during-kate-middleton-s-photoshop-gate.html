Despite the humorous<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> conspiracy theories</a>, rumors, and internet fodder about his wife's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Photoshop fail</a> (and overall well-being), William wasted no time getting back to business. While royal fans — well, pretty much the entire world — speculated about the meaning behind <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Kate Middleton</a>'s photo-editing snafu on Monday, William continued with his royal duties.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">ICYMI, Middleton shared a photo with their three kids, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, to social media on Sunday. Eagle-eyed social media users were quick to point out the Photoshop blunders, and Middleton took to Instagram and X again to release an apology.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the meantime, William attended Commonwealth Day&nbsp;celebrations at Westminster Abbey, alongside Queen Camilla, who is filling in for her husband King Charles amid his cancer diagnosis. He and his stepmother were photographed at the service, as well as interacting with guests. The queen wore an electric blue coat dress with a teal fascinator, while William opted for a navy suit and sea-foam green tie.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the annual ceremony, William then headed to The Earthshot Prize Launchpad event in London. For his second event, he swapped out his green tie for a blue floral one.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Although his wife Middleton did not accompany him to the festivities, the husband-and-wife duo were seen departing <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Windsor Castle together</a> in a car in photographs obtained by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a>. The outlet reported that William was dropping Middleton off at a private appointment before heading to his appearances. The sighting marked the couple's first outing together since Christmas, where they attended Christmas morning service with their kids.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Once the controversial Mother's Day image was removed from photo agencies and outlets, like Associated Press, due to image manipulation, Middleton took to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>social media to apologize</a>. "Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused," she wrote on Monday. "I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother’s Day.
