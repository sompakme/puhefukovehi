Unfortunately for Mos Def, he might not get to see any of the profits from their shows together. According to court papers obtained by The New York Post, the money from the tour may have to go to artist Karima Sorel. Sorel and Mos Def have a child together and he reportedly owes over $88,000 in child support.</p><p>Sorel is allegedly suing various companies associated with the tour including Ticketmaster and Live Nation in an attempt to get the money she's owed paid out from the tour. This isn't the first time the pair have had issues as it related to child support payments. A few years ago a court ruling forced Mos Def to cover Sorel's attorney fees when it came to light that he consistently failed to pay child support. That precedent may loom large over future court proceedings involving the two.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mos-def-s-court-battle-for-his-tour-earnings>Mos Def's Court Battle For His Tour Earnings</h2></span><p>NEWARK, NEW JERSEY - NOVEMBER 19: Yasiin Bey performs during the Represent!

The pair will tour for a month and a half before returning to Texas to close the tour in July. Mos Def most recently released new music alongside longtime<a href=# rel> collaborator Talib Kweli as Black Star</a> with last year's No Fear Of Time. The album was released exclusively to the podcast network Luminary which left many fans unable to hear it. To promote the album the pair played two of the songs from it live on Saturday Night Live.</p><p>Fittingly, another place you can hear from Mos Def this summer is on a different <a href=# rel>podcast network, Audible</a>. A few months ago the platform announced a Hip Hop 50th anniversary series coming this summer. Alongside Mos Def the project also seeks to celebrate the contributions made to rap music by artists like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Snoop Dogg</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>Lil Kim</a>.
