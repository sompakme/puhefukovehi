Regardless, it's clear that this has the potential to cause some other direct beef between these MCs, an issue that came up when it comes to The Game and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a>. Moreover, the former posted an Instagram Story this week that many feel like is connected to the latter, and the reason why is the context of Kendrick and Drizzy's feud. Whether or not this was really intentional, it lines up with everything else that the two have said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"It be the fat n***as wit the skinny legs always running they mouth," The Game wrote, who is <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">firmly on Team Drake</a>. Rick Ross supports Kendrick Lamar, and while there's no confirmation that the Los Angeles spitter actually meant to attack him, it's understandable why there would be some conflict here. Also, it checks out because Rozay's been a massive social media troll in all of this against the 6ix God, speaking on his diss tracks and pushing that side of the narrative. That's something that no one involved in this can deny: it's all optics at this point.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-game-appears-to-take-shots-at-rick-ross>The Game Appears To Take Shots At Rick Ross</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, there is reason to believe that The Game and Rick Ross' issues run deeper than this, and already ran deep before this whole situation spiraled quickly out of control. All the way back in 2016, the former's manager <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">denied that the latter was the one to squash Game's beef</a> with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Meek Mill</a>, and maybe these sentiments have kept them at odds with each other. We'll see whether the <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Maybach Music Group</a> boss decides to switch targets and go at the Documentary creative and we can see another phase of this. But most fans probably don't want that anymore.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Joe Budden</a> previously <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">compared the two MCs</a> in 2019 if you want to hear a take on their prowess on the mic. We also can't rule out that The Game and Rick Ross won't beef with other artists as a result of all this. After all, neither shies away from their beliefs and lifestyles, which always ruffles feathers. Only time will tell, but can they at least wait until we're all a little less exhausted by rap beef?</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop.
