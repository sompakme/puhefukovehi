From hair colors to fresh cuts, tonight’s Creative Arts Emmy Awards were certainly an example of this phenomenon, and one of the standout new looks of the night was from Julianne Hough, who debuted a brand new, chic hairstyle when she presented at the ceremony.&nbsp;</p><p>The look, a blunt blonde bob, is perfectly in line with the trends of the season, from hair lightening to dramatic cuts, and Hough epitomizes the energy of 2023-2024 winter beauty with her new ‘do.</p><p>“Cutting a lot of hair at one time is releasing a lot of old energy at once,” explains her hairstylist, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.instagram.com/riawna/?hl=en" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Riawna Capri</a>. “Which is why a lot of people cry and have an overwhelming feeling when you chop that much. It’s beautiful really, to see all the tears of letting go.” She notes, though, that “there were no tears here with Jules! On the contrary to a cry release, a lot of times there is an exciting overwhelming energized feeling of letting go as well. And that is what she had. About 3 times she was like, ‘I think we can even go shorter!’”</p><p>The result is a chin-length, ultra modern look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bvuyvRm88M4J2ohFVbVyYV-1920-80.jpeg><p>Capri also explains that Hough’s new style came about because she “wanted a bright bold change for the new year.” Apparently, Hough had been “talking about going short for a few months now. And one day at Dancing with the Stars, it hit her. She was ready. I could feel it. And we instantly started looking at the calendar to see when was best.”&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Hough’s bright blonde color, brown at the roots, comes courtesy of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.randco.com/collections/color-care referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=skimlinks data-placeholder-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1662120&xcust=hawk-custom-tracking&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.randco.com%2Fcollections%2Fcolor-care&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.marieclaire.com%2Fbeauty%2Fjulianne-hough-creative-Arts-Emmy-Award-2024" data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name="SkimLinks - randco.com" data-merchant-id=undefined data-merchant-url=undefined data-merchant-network=undefined><u>R & Co.

Capri says that she used over 300 foil to achieve the soft blonde look, and then toned it to “a bright yet buttery blonde.”&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t a practice she recommends trying on your own at home, though. If you’re looking to chop and lighten your locks à la Hough-and-Capri, consult your trusted hairstylist and/or colorist.&nbsp;</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

It feels so good to be able to have so many changes over all the years and yet still create something new. To have a client stick with you for 15 years is the biggest honor any hairstylist could ask for, especially in Hollywood.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJqVlsK1xY6jrKWhkaO7pnnHqKygoF2Yv6at06KtnmVxp8G0eaSmpLJlcayus7CMa2drbF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
