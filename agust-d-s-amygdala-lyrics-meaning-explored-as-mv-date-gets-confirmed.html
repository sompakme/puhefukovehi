Amygdala means the region of the brain which is primarily associated with emotional processes.</p><p>But in <a href=#>BTS ARMY</a>-verse, Amygdala takes on a deeper meaning as one explained: “the Amygdala attaches emotional meaning to memories and detects danger, taking control over your body to protect you, when he says “my Amygdala come and save me,” it’s like he is asking it to activate his fight or flight response so he can deal with the pain from those memories.”</p><p>Amygdala is deeply personal as a rather vulnerable <a href=#>Suga</a> talks about painful memories and unfortunate incidents he had to go through asking ARMY as AMYGDALA to come and save him from those memories.</p><p>In the pre-chorus he sings, “I don’t know your name, your name, your name/ Travelling to my memories/ I don’t know your name, your name, your name/ Now, let’s erase them one by one, yes, one by one.”</p><p>In the chorus, Suga asks, “My amygdala (My amygdala)/ Save me, hurry up and get me out of here.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=fans-get-emotional-over-amygdalas-lyrics>Fans get emotional over Amygdala’s lyrics</h2><p>Suga’s Amygdala lyrics are so raw, it’s making fans shed tears: “After reading the lyrics, I wanted to get a better understanding of the meaning of amygdala. I’m crying so hard…he went through so much more than we ever imagined. Thank you for trusting us Yoongi. We will love & support you always.”</p><p>Another called it a favorite from D-Day, “I didn’t think I had a favorite but I really think amygdala is. The way she says “my amygdala” it’s like she’s dear to him like his unconscious that came out of her is holding him tight, this song has such a deep meaning.”</p><p>A third fan posted:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>there's something about AMYGDALA that makes me want to cry so hard.. it's too personal for me and I can somewhat relate to the meaning of the song..
