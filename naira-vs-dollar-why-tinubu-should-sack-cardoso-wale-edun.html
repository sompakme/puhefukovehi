It’s sad that Tinubu continued from where Buhari stopped. The government of Padi Padi. "Only in Nigeria will the country's financial officers adopt unreal policies to protect the weak currency and recruit many bodies to carry out day-to-day propaganda on the media. "Binance was never an issue. Binance had been in Nigeria long before these people came to power. Mr Cardoso, under the president's instruction, floated the naira at the very wrong time, which led to borrowing money to defend the naira. They choose to blame finance because they are not used to taking responsibility. "They have blamed parents who have kids schooling abroad, they have blamed BDC agents, and they hope they won’t one day blame God for their own frivolous actions. <a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/55c490ad82801ab5.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How Jonathan predicted Buhari's failure, Nigeria's economic crisis, video emerges</span></p></a>"The only solution is for the president to sack both Wale Edun and Yemi Cardoso and then recruit worthy candidates who can create proper policies that will change the current system; the question is, does the president himself understand the country's real situation?
