On Saturday, Kate answered several questions related to the research in a video posted to Instagram.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who sent in their questions. There are a huge number here with loads of wonderful emojis attached to them," Kate began, before revealing why she first became interested in the project. “I think people assume that because I am a parent, that’s why I’ve taken an interest in the Early Years. I think this really is bigger than that."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She added, “This isn’t just about happy, healthy children. This is about the society I hope we could and can become. Right from the early days, meeting lots of people who are suffering with addiction or poor mental health and hearing time and time again that their troubles now in adulthood stem right back from early childhood experience."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, when a question came up about managing "toddler tantrums," Kate, who is a mom to three children — Prince George, 7, Princess Charlotte, 5, and Prince Louis, 2 — turned to the experts for advice. “Yes, that’s a hard one. I’d also like to ask the experts myself!” she jokingly replied.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8qaq55lnZ6xpbjEraanZZeqsKS1jKmsrKupYq%2Bww4ybo6ito5p6s7HWnpir</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
