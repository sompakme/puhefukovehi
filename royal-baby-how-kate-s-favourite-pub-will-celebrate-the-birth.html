Owner John Haley, who was invited to the royal wedding at Westminster Abbey in 2011, has revealed to HELLO! Online how the pub will celebrate the birth of the royal baby - though he stresses they have no inside knowledge about when the new little Prince or Princess will make an entrance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But John says his regulars don't mind either way. <strong>"We're guessing a girl as she has a boy already</strong>, but they don’t mind as long as everyone is happy and healthy," he says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a66425365f0a-the-old-boot-inn-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eV1xSujG5hBj data-wc=14><strong>The Old Boot Inn is Kate's preferred pub of choice when visiting her parents</strong></p><p id=erZkjJI9KIV9 data-wc=33>John also says that like many pubs up and down the country,<strong> in 2013 the locals did place bets on the<a class=hm-link href=#> royal baby's birth date</a>, weight, and sex</strong>, but this time around, they haven't been as prepared.</p><p id=eV51NeZTpZ-y data-wc=26>He says: "We might, especially if it does last until next week when we have the party, so I might set it up again this weekend."</p><p id=ePE_dJwTFcQK data-wc=43>John has been welcoming guests to 18th century free house The Old Boot Inn for 17 years. Though he doesn't see Kate as much these days, he says: "<strong>We see plenty of her when she pops down to see her mum and dad.</strong>"</p><p id=eBbgiyVGXwPF data-wc=73>When the Duchess does stop by, she asks for no special treatment and "eats off the normal menu", according to John. By the time of her next visit, there may be a new selection of dishes for Kate to choose from, with a menu possibly in the works - inspired by the new royal baby. "I may think of a special one for next week, maybe we’ll get some baby names," he says.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
