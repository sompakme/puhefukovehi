After her big break on the dance show, JoJo began uploading videos to YouTube in 2015, mainly to answer questions from "Dance Moms" fans and give her side of the story, so to speak, as <a href=# data-analytics-module=body_link data-analytics-post-depth=20 data-uri=f0f088e8933f48d41f9b6c679925bd23>Rolling Stone</a> detailed. By that time, she had moved to Los&nbsp;Angeles, Calif. with her mother, Jessalynn, while her father, Tom, and older brother, Jayden, stayed in Nebraska so he could finish school.&nbsp;</p><p>She let fans in on her life, touring the one-bedroom apartment she shared with Jessalynn in Glendale and participating in popular internet contests.&nbsp;YouTube proved to be the perfect platform for JoJo to build her brand. Soon, her channel was one of the most-followed on YouTube, <a href=#>Insider</a> noted.&nbsp;"I never forget where I came from with YouTube. I wouldn't be where I am today without it," JoJo told Rolling Stone.</p><p>In 2016, JoJo broke out into the music scene with <a href=#>her single, "Boomerang,"</a> in which she addressed the issue of bullying. Though she was mainly homeschooled, JoJo returned to public school for a semester in third grade and witnessed peers bullying students constantly, per Rolling Stone. She then began to experience virtual bullying on social media as she gained popularity.&nbsp;"[E]very day people comment, 'You're fat, you're ugly, you're rude, you're all this stuff ... I don't want anyone to have to go through that," she told <a href=#>Billboard</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWxkZX5ze9OhnGasopa7tLLOq6SarJmku267xWahqKKfYsCqw8BmnaunnWKwqbXLnZ%2Bop5RiwbB5kHFksp2Rp8Buu8udZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
