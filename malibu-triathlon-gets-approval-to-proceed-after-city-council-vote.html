The Malibu Triathlon, a fundraiser for Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, will take place on Saturday and Sunday. In a statement received by The Hollywood Reporter, triathlon officials thanked the Malibu City Council for “working with us” to ensure the event could go on as planned.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“We are fully focused on delivering an enjoyable and life-changing experience for so many athletes while also generating significant funds for Children’s Hospital Los Angeles (CHLA),” reads the statement. “We are proud to announce that we have already reached the $1 million fundraising mark for CHLA in 2023. This is an incredible achievement of which we are very proud and we hope to raise even more funds in the days, weeks and years to come.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The&nbsp;<a href=#>Malibu</a>&nbsp;Triathlon is a high-profile annual event that in years past has hosted the likes of&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_matthew-mcconaughey_1 data-tag=matthew-mcconaughey>Matthew McConaughey</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_jennifer-lopez_1 data-tag=jennifer-lopez>Jennifer Lopez</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_zac-efron_1 data-tag=zac-efron>Zac Efron</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# id=auto-tag_max-greenfield_1 data-tag=max-greenfield>Max Greenfield</a>&nbsp;and Mark Feuerstein. Organizers recently confirmed a change in the course forced by flooding in the Zuma Underpass, a result of high precipitation in the Los Angeles area this year. Before the water could be cleared, translucent two-inch fish called tidewater goby took up residence there.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Triathlon organizers teamed with City of Malibu officials and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and Beaches and Harbors to hatch a plan that protected the fish and its new habitat while minimizing “our impact on the local ecosystem.” In doing so, they proposed a course change but the permit was “denied on a technicality,” organizers confirm in the emailed statement. That technicality is that residents in the area must be notified 32 days prior to an event and that deadline has come and gone.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">However, during the council meeting, it was pointed out that officials had mailed notices to residents giving them enough of a heads up and that many in the area have come to expect the triathlon as an annual tradition in September. This year’s event will be the 38th on record. As part of the change, the Olympic distance was shortened to 14.4 miles from 25 while the Classic Distance went down to 10.8 miles from 17.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Curiously enough, one city council member pointed out during the meeting that he had received an unconfirmed report from a source that there are currently no tidewater goby to be found in the underpass. The vote to approve the event offers a collective sigh of relief to race participants, many of whom have flooded social media in recent days to plead for it to go on as planned, citing months of training and non-refundable race fees and hotel, airfare and rental car reservations.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On Wednesday, organizers revealed participants for the celebrity division race on Oct. 1. Competing at Zuma Beach will be Diplo, Chace Crawford, Trixie Mattel, Daniela Ruah, Jesse Metcalfe, Timothy Olyphant, Ben Higgins, ChefRush&nbsp;and more. They roster will swim, bike and run as they raise funds for the Pediatric Cancer Research Program at CHLA. The celebrity division race consists of a 0.5 mile swim, 9.6-mile adjusted bike ride and 4-mile run.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Wednesday, Sept. 27 at 12:26 p.m.</strong>: Updated to include roster of celebrity participants.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue82erqxnnKSworiMp5ywq1%2Birq21wa5kraqZlsGpuM6nZJqooKe8t63LZpqoraKosm6vx5qloJ1dZn90gZVpZ3FsZmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
