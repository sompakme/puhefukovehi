Back in 2021, Dick made an appearance on the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show with Zoe Ball, where he revealed that they'd been living in the chateau's renovated coach house:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/75cfb8e454e2-angel-dick-strawbridge-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e29Ot7CCZ7k- data-wc=10><strong>During lockdown Angel's parents lived in the chateau's coach house</strong></p><p id=e0H2OPz3YsDr data-wc=62>"It's not like we've been confined - there's so much space and doing things with the children. We've been quite lucky, as a family I think we've come through it well. Of course, <strong>we've got Angela's mum and dad living across in the coach house</strong>, so we've got a family unit here, which sort of has support, <strong>which is very lucky indeed</strong>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/4be82b195898-angel-dick-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eorCtWxF1Akl data-wc=10><strong>She credits her parents with inspiring her strong work ethic</strong></p><p id=e-qVVwoZ3i5j data-wc=23>While little is known about Angel's parents, she has spoken about them on occasion. During an about , she said:</p><p id=eyf0e5LPRVGM data-wc=81>"Before we [she and Dick] met we both had strong work ethics. <strong>My mum and dad are workaholics, my dad owned Paradise jewellers in Benfleet for 20 years</strong> and a restaurant (Flutes). My brother Paul now runs the jewellers on Canvey Island. <strong>It's nice to instil those values early on because it's important</strong>. I think the Essex mindset is more go and get it. Maybe not coming from a plethora of wealth can make you a bit more hungry for it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/54349eb018ec-the-chateau-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=elTEVNfYZChf data-wc=15><strong>Angel's parents are always on hand to help with the chateau in the busier seasons</strong></p><p id=ergwqSFm0E3H data-wc=19>She also opened up about having her parents around to help with the chateau, especially in the busier seasons.&nbsp;</p><p id=eW9ZvzZF03-s data-wc=51>"<strong>We have a bit of a giggle that they're here for free holidays</strong>, but they're here more for the wedding season to help us," she said. "<strong>Having a multi-generational living arrangement is quite special</strong>. When I'm older, if Arthur and Dorothy want us around, we'll feel like we've done something right."</p><p id=eR2VDQY0aBIy data-wc=15></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
