Especially when that coupon promises delicious Subway sandwiches at a fraction of the price. But the question remains: how do you, my penny-pinching pal, become the chosen one, blessed by the Subway gods with a coupon avalanche?</p><p data-sourcepos=5:1-5:228><strong>Here's the TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read) for the impatient:</strong> There isn't a foolproof signup system for snail mail Subway coupons.
