When these hormones fluctuate, the tissues in your body accumulate more water. The result is water retention, or edema. Water retention may cause swelling or puffiness in your breasts, stomach, or extremities.<h2>Should I weigh myself on my period?</h2>A person should also avoid weighing themselves on the days before their period. During the week leading up to menstruation, hormones cause fluctuations in weight.

Typically, no. While experts largely agree that resting metabolic rates fluctuate during the menstrual cycle, the change is negligible. Given this minimal difference, most women will not burn many more calories than usual.<h2>Why do I weigh so much but don't look it?</h2>Muscle is denser than fat, and as it is more compact within your body, as you gain muscle mass, you end up looking thinner, no matter your physical weight. So, if you've been doing a lot of strength training lately, it's likely this is the reason that you're looking fantastic but not dropping those numbers.<h2>IS morning skinny your real weight?</h2>According to a study done by Live Strong, “Not only do you look slimmer in the morning, but you actually weigh less, too.” While good night's sleep alone isn't enough to make you lose major pounds, you do burn calories while you sleep. “When we sleep at night, our body enters a fasting period,” said Dr.<h2>Should I weigh myself before or after pooping?</h2>The best time to weigh yourself is in the morning on an empty stomach.

Although an episode of overeating can happen to anyone occasionally, some people have a binge eating disorder, which usually requires professional attention.<h2>Why did I gain 10 pounds in a week?</h2>While some weight fluctuation is normal, a fluctuation of 10 pounds is a little excessive. Overnight weight gain can be the result of water retention, changes in metabolism, and the timing of meals. People weigh different amounts at different times of the day, too.<h2>Do you need more sleep on your period?</h2>PMS can cause some women to sleep much more than normal.
