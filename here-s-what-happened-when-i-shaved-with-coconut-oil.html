And aside from the unfortunate homemade hair conditioner incident that left me smelling like a side salad, I’m incredibly impressed by how much better natural beauty products perform compared to their chemically challenged competition. (Not to mention how much easier they are on my wallet.)</p><p><a tabindex=0 href=# class=lrv-u-flex@tablet><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Range-Beauty.png alt="This Clean Beauty Brand Creates Makeup is Dermatologist-Approved" height width style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="c-span u-letter-spacing-015 lrv-u-text-transform-uppercase a-font-secondary-bold-s lrv-u-font-size-14 lrv-u-margin-t-050 lrv-u-margin-t-1@desktop lrv-u-margin-b-025 u-margin-tb-00@tablet lrv-u-display-block">Related story</span> <span class="c-title a-font-secondary-medium-s@mobile-max a-font-primary-xs@tablet lrv-u-line-height-normal lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-margin-b-1 u-margin-t-050@tablet lrv-u-padding-b-025 lrv-u-color-brand-primary:hover">This Black-Owned Beauty Brand Creates Makeup That's Dermatologist-Approved & Made for ‘Ultra-Reactive Skin’</span></a></p><p>After saving up some serious leg hair for the task (don’t mention it), I decided I would shave one leg with <a data-pmc-sp-product=31d02b947d94e11a4e8dabb0c2517dff href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"coconut oil","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Viva Naturals Organic Coconut Oil - Unrefined, Cold-Pressed Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, USDA Organic and Non-GMO Cooking Oil, Great as Hair Oil and Skin Oil, 16 fl oz","price":"8.99","id":"B00DS842HS","category":"Coconut"},"id":1069507,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>coconut oil</a>, and the other with my usual shaving cream to compare. Shaving in subzero temperatures has always been a challenge for me, but even more so since I turned 30. My skin now soaks up moisturizer like those sponge pocket men on the paper towel commercials, and no matter how much I use after shaving I always feel a tad… prickly.</p><h3>The application</h3><p>Don’t be alarmed by the texture of the coconut oil: It starts out solid, but on contact it turns to liquid. A little goes a long way too. Unlike slathering endless dollops of shaving cream onto your legs, you only need about a teaspoon of coconut oil per leg.</p><p>Once you’ve applied it to your legs, I highly recommend rinsing your hands thoroughly before picking up your razor. My hands ended up so slippery I spent more time fishing my razor from behind the toilet than I did mowing my legs.</p><h3>The process</h3><p>Coconut oil leg: It was one of the closest, smoothest shaves I’ve had in a long time! The coconut oil didn’t gunk up my blade like (cough cough) most shaving creams do. I never thought it was possible for something to moisturize your skin during the shaving process&nbsp;— it seriously threw my dry skin a bone.</p><p>Shaving cream leg: One, I had to use three times as much shaving cream as I did coconut oil. Two, it totally gunked up my blade, so there were several spots I had to go over twice. Three, my leg may have been moisturized to start, but by the time I was done with all the swiping and scraping, I could tell I’d be paying for it later.</p><h3>The verdict</h3><p>Coconut oil isn’t just better than shaving cream, it’s way better. An hour after shaving, the leg I shaved with coconut oil is still feeling silky, soft and irritation free. The leg I shaved with shaving cream? It’s drier than the desert. Patches of my skin have gone from irritated to flat out furious. It won’t be long until I’ll have to slather on another half-bottle of moisturizer to avoid the really uncomfortable, really unsexy red, swollen splotches that come from Canadian winters.</p><p>Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to unclog my drain.</p><h3>More shaving tips</h3><p><a href=#>DIY 2-ingredient moisturizing shaving gel<br></a><a href=#>Pre-shave: How to prep your legs for a great shave<br></a><a href=#>The best way to shave your legs</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLTEpKWor6NjsLC5jqWgr6GenHyivtOimqWdo2R%2BcYKYbmdwZ6Odrre1zaBksKGknXqku8Kopa6sXaS2rXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
