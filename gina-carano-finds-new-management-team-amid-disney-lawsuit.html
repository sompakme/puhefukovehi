I feel relieved to push the refresh button in signing on with Rob, and I am as ambitious as ever in this new chapter of my life and career. We are already actively working on a new television series that I am ecstatic about that is unlike anything I’ve done thus far and are actively attracting creatives from all over who are excited to collaborate,” Carano said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Gina Carano is not only an exceptional talent but a wonderful human being and we are thrilled to be joining her in the next chapter of her career,” Weston said.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Carano <a href=#>was fired</a> by Lucasfilm after sharing a post on social media that read, “most people today don’t realize that to get to the point where Nazi soldiers could easily round up thousands of Jews, the government first made their own neighbors hate them simply for being Jews. How is that any different from hating someone for their political views?”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In early February, Carano <a href=#>filed suit against</a> Disney and Lucasfilm alleging discrimination and wrongful termination, saying she was fired for voicing right-wing opinions. She also seeks a court order that would force Lucasfilm to cast her again.&nbsp;She had previously appeared in Fast & Furious 6 and Deadpool. Since The Mandalorian, Carano has appeared in Terror on the Prairie and My Son Hunter.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmoKGelnqkrdGapahlnprEbrnAp5ignZ2au7V5056YpmWRoralecOiqqedqWK5osPSrqCtZWFngHaElGlvamtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
