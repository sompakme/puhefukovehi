Now, DC is delivering an Injustice movie with an impressive cast voicing these iconic characters, as reported by <a href=#>The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</p><p>The Injustice movie, like its source material, takes place on an Earth where Superman loses control and ends up fighting his fellow superheroes. After getting tricked by the Joker, the Kryptonian kills Lois Lane. Things escalate to make him go off the rails as he attempts to take control of the planet.</p><p>Check out the first look for the Injustice movie below.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/injustice-movie-dc.jpg><p>The Injustice movie will be produced by Warner Bros. Animation, DC, and Warner Bros. Home Entertainment.</p><p>We got the details on the character roster with the actors voicing these villains and heroes for the Injustice movie. It will feature Justin Hartley (This is Us) as Superman, <a href=#>Anson Mount</a> (Star Trek: Discovery) as Batman, Laura Bailey (The Last of Us Part 2) as Lois Lane and Rama Kushna, Zach Callison (Steven Universe) as Damian and Jimmy Olsen, Brian T. Delaney (Fallout 4) as Green Lantern, Brandon Michael Hall (A One Sided Affair) as Cyborg, <a href=#>Edwin Hodge</a> (The Tomorrow War) as Mr. Terrific and Killer Croc, Oliver Hudson (Scream Queens) as Plastic Man, <a href=#>Gillian Jacobs</a> (Community) as Harley Quinn, Yuri Lowenthal (Marvel’s Spider-Man) as Mirror Master, Flash, and Shazam, Derek Phillips (Them) as Nightwing and Aquaman, Kevin Pollak (The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) as Joker and Jonathan Kent, Anika Noni Rose (Ralph Breaks the Internet) as Catwoman, Reid Scott (Veep) as Green Arrow and Victor Zsasz, Faran Tahir (Iron Man) as Ra’s al Ghul, Fred Tatasciore (Kung Fu Panda 2) as Captain Atom, Janet Varney (The Legend of Korra) as Wonder Woman, and Andrew Morgado (The Casagrandes) as Mirror Master Soldier.</p><p>Matt Peters is directing the Injustice movie. He has directed some Lego DC shorts for various characters like Shazam and Batman, but this is his first film. Ernie Altbacker will write the script. He has penned other DC animated movies in the past like Batman: Hush and Justice League Dark: Apokolips War. Rick Morales, Jim Krieg, and Sam Register are producing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/injustice-gods-among-us-900x692.jpg><p>The Injustice movie is taking more notes from the comic book series, which was written mostly by Tom Taylor, with Brian Buccellato taking the reigns for Year Three–Year Five: #8–12. It was illustrated by a variety of people like&nbsp;Jheremy Raapack, who has worked on a variety of DC comics. It went from 2013 to 2016 with 153 digital issues and 60 print.</p><p>In 2013, there was also the video game, which it appears will not inspire the Injustice movie. NetherRealm, which a name for itself for taking over Mortal Kombat in 2011, had its own take on the story as a game. The popularity of the DC fighting game where players could pit heroes or villains against one another got the studio to develop a sequel. In 2017, Injustice 2 was an even bigger hit with some new additions like being able to upgrade characters with pieces of armor.</p><p>The Injustice: Gods Among Us movie will hit this fall for home viewing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2ihnp%2FCtMDInJxmpZ%2BrtqZ6x62kpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
