And if you're in the market for a new perfume, you want to make sure you're satisfied with your choice once you try it on yourself. This seems simple enough, but more often than not we hear people lament their experience with it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've found yourself frustrated with your experience with fragrance before, you're likely making one of the following perfume mistakes. And look, we don't believe there are hard-cut rules when it comes to how you wear your fragrance (you do you) but since fragrance is such a science, there are actions you can take to satisfy your needs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Below, two perfume experts share some of the most common mistakes people make when choosing a perfume, applying it, and storing it — plus, they're tips on what to do instead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mistake-1-rubbing-your-wrists-together-after-applying-perfume></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mistake #1: Rubbing Your Wrists Together After Applying Perfume</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We've heard over and over again to apply perfume to our pulse points — notably our wrists. Over time it may have become second nature to spritz your fragrance to this area and immediately rub the inside of your wrists together to set the scent or make it dry down faster. However, doing so is a major mistake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The National Fragrance Ambassador for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Maison Margiela REPLICA</a>, Ross Barry, explains that rubbing scents together crushes the scent molecules. As such, the integrity of the fragrance breaks. Instead, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Veronique Gabai</a>, who is the founder of her eponymous fragrance brand, says to either tap the wrists gently or simply let it air. "This will keep the scent intact," she explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mistake-2-spritzing-perfume-on-dry-skin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mistake #2: Spritzing Perfume On Dry Skin</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you feel as if your perfume doesn't last as long as you'd like it to, it could be because you applied it on dry skin. "Fragrance stays longer on hydrated skin, so make sure to lotion up," recommends Barry. For the best results, use a fragrance-free lotion so the scents don't counter each other.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mistake-3-storing-your-perfume-in-the-bathroom></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mistake #3: Storing Your Perfume In the Bathroom</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it's surely convenient to have your fragrances stored with the rest of your beauty products in the bathroom, doing so is a major no-no. Barry explains that humidity breaks down the scent faster than if it were stored somewhere dry, and even says that your fragrance will last twice as long if you do.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mistake-4-applying-perfume-throughout-the-day></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mistake #4: Applying Perfume Throughout the Day</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you applied a decent amount of perfume in the morning but failed to smell it on yourself an hour later, you're not alone. However, this doesn't mean the scent has faded. Gabai explains that your brain has processed the smell as normal, and as such, your nose stops detecting it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By continuously spritzing yourself with more perfume throughout the day, you risk creating an overwhelming scent by applying too much. Not to mention, you'll go through your bottle faster than expected. Instead, touch up once at the end of the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO; An Expert's Guide to Finding Your Signature Scent</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mistake-5-buying-perfume-without-testing-it-first></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mistake #5: Buying Perfume Without Testing It First</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Online shopping makes our lives easier — nobody is debating that. However, nothing replaces smelling perfume on your skin, no matter how accurate the description of it is.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Smelling a perfume on a blotter is fine for a quick curation, but it will not give you the reality of your interaction with the scent," says Gabai. For the best results, she says to sample perfume on your skin as we all have a natural scent that mixes uniquely when mixed with perfume.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mistake-6-smelling-several-perfumes-one-after-the-other></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mistake #6: Smelling Several Perfumes One After the Other</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've ever been wine tasting, you know not to test five reds one after the other. Instead, you're encouraged to cleanse your palette to reset your taste buds before moving on to the next glass. The same concept applies to scent.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sniffing different blends in a small time frame can affect how your brain computes the smell. As such, it's important to give your nose a reset before moving onto the next perfume.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You may be thinking that you know just the trick — sniffing coffee beans in between fragrances — but Gabai says this is a myth and even a little misleading. "It will mask what you have smelled before but will not give you a clean palate to continue smelling more scents properly," she explains. Instead, she recommends simply breathing in and out with an emphasis on the exhale, making it last longer than it typically does.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mistake-7-storing-your-perfume-in-the-sunlight></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mistake #7: Storing Your Perfume In the Sunlight</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Perfume can last a long time, as long as you keep it away from light and heat," says Gabai, who points out that a lot of people like to store their fragrances on a vanity. Instead, she says to store them in a cool drawer. "This will be better for the juice inside," she explains.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-mistake-8-having-just-one-signature-scent></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_44-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Mistake #8: Having Just One Signature Scent</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don't get us wrong, we all have our favorite fragrances that we keep going back to. However, as scent is so personal and can help set the mood for the day it makes sense to have a few you can alternate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love to wear something different to match my mood or moment," agrees Barry. "You don't wear the same outfit every day, so why do the same with scent?"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLOzrcarmKeblWS9pr7FrqSeZZ2ewLWtyp6q</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
