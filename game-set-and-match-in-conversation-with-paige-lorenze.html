We’ve been dating ever since,” she said.</p><p id=eLCVnRSvovB data-wc=38>Paige, who is also an accomplished alpine skier, equestrian, The New School alumna, and the founder of the lifestyle brands Dairy Boy and American Charm, explains what she feels has contributed to the recent upturn of tennis' popularity.</p><p id=eNX6v2SLko3 data-wc=55>"I think now has been the perfect storm for this sport. And I really cannot contribute to one thing. The history of tennis influencing fashion has a rich past, so it was always going to make a comeback," she says in reference to tenniscore—the preppy, athletic aesthetic trend that is oh so popular right now.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/f5836bda4d4e-6.jpg><p id=efRSIspbalp data-wc=56>"And then also, there's a resurgence of exciting young players, specifically in America," she continues, "Tommy has talked to me about how tennis was really big in America 15 or 20 years ago, when [Andre] Agassi and [Andy] Roddick were playing. So I think that's contributed to the pop culture aspect, which has attracted new fans."</p><p id=eSogLyyos5B data-wc=35>"People are kind of shocked when I say this, but I think that F1's popularity has also bled over to tennis, it's a completely different sport, but they are both about following individuals, following personalities."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">More From The June Digital Issue:</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="10 Luxury travel minis to take on your next trip" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b3b5eb8e9abe-travel-minatures.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="10 Luxury travel minis to take on your next trip" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>10 Luxury travel minis to take on your next trip</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Paris To Provence: Your Guide To Making The Most Of The Olympics in Paris This Summer" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/7f49075048f8-france-travel-guide.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Paris To Provence: Your Guide To Making The Most Of The Olympics in Paris This Summer" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Paris To Provence: Your Guide To Making The Most Of The Olympics in Paris This Summer</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e6g8q1pxWRq data-wc=57>Then there was the 2024 rollout of three blockbuster tennis-themed features that must also be credited with the recent growth in popularity. King Richard is a biographical drama following the rise of Venus and Serena Williams. Box-office champion, stars Zendaya as first lady of the tennis wives who was apparently based on Roger Federer’s wife, Mirka.</p><p id=eWuAEk3rqI5 data-wc=27>And , a behind-the-scenes Netflix series following the lives of top tennis players as they travel the world for tournaments. The latter featured Paige and Tommy.&nbsp;</p><p id=eKHmDWCbQMZ data-wc=43>So does she feel they are a fair representation of life behind the scenes and did she enjoy them? "I really liked , my friend Ayan, who's dating Frances Tiafoe, was a double for Venus in the movie, so that was cool."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/b867e4e4edac-4.jpg><figure class="HFMQuote_hd2j4x3 quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-editions-june-2024 -style-2"><p>"I love a competitive environment, and when you are around athletes, the coolest person in the room is the one who works the hardest"</p></figure><p id=eFMLV22s8OP data-wc=65>"It did a good job of showing what it really takes being a little kid obsessed with tennis. To be at the top you have to be obsessed with it. You can be a really good athletic, but what sets the top players apart is their mentality. You have to be really OK with the fact that your whole life's going to be about tennis."</p><p id=eM7lCaUQGvN data-wc=44>"And obviously was such a drama that was based on a romance and juniors, so it was sort of silly - but I think they're all great movies. Anytime someone's talking or paying an ode to tennis, it's a win for the sport."</p><p id=eWpCz2MhLK2 data-wc=39>Although she appeared in it, Paige admits she didn’t watch all 16 episodes of . However, she believes that because it is based on real players, it provides true insight into how taxing the sport is for them.</p><p id=eJJPFI4U3lI data-wc=84>"You don't really get to know that side of the sport unless you're really in the weeds with it," she explains, "Tennis has a glamour attached to it, but what people don’t see is that the majority of the season is a grind for these players. They barely have any time off. It takes a tremendous amount of work and dedication. Grand Slam matches can last six hours, and some of these players can barely walk the next day. It's a pretty crazy sport."</p><figure class="HFMQuote_hd2j4x3 quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-editions-june-2024 -style-2"><p id=eGCAt7PHi2k>"I think my personal style in general has evolved a lot through tennis and these matches"</p></figure><p id=eLK4u4j0iIS4 data-wc=50>The gruelling schedule includes four Grand Slam tournaments each year, each lasting two weeks: the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open. In addition, there are the ATP and WTA tours. And so, the relentless travel is made a bit easier for Tommy because Paige accompanies him.</p><p id=elsr7dPVBgo8 data-wc=49>"I'm kind of bringing a piece of home on the road with him, so I love being able to do that," she smiles. "It's nice to explore together, it is fun to travel with a buddy. We do go to a lot of museums and restaurants when we can."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/e0e5ba137a2b-5-ferragamo-look-miumiu-bag.jpg><p id=eBNU_y5J8Ql1 data-wc=51>Luckily, Paige is also a fan of the game, "I do love it and I am truly a fan, but I love him first. I love supporting him and what he's doing and how hard he's working. It's so inspiring to me, and I love being a part of his journey."</p><p id=eoeNTdDt3kf4 data-wc=55>"So much about tennis is heartbreaking. Players are losing every week because there can only be one winner. You have to become comfortable with losing, because that's such a big part of the sport. Obviously, the goal is to win, but when Tommy reaches the semi-finals, even making it that far is actually a victory."</p><figure class="HFMQuote_hd2j4x3 quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-editions-june-2024 -style-2"><p>"I'm just there to support him, no matter what the results are"</p></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/5a8834d639ab-3.jpg><p id=efZst_DKu8-l data-wc=52>Paige explains that she has learned not to become too emotionally invested and instead focuses on just being there for Tommy. "I've been able to maintain a good relationship with everything involved in the travelling I do with him, because I'm just there to support him, no matter what the results are."</p><p id=egHWJaVokACA data-wc=60>Also enduring the hectic schedule are the other WAGs, and I’m told they are a sociable group. "We always try to get together and do things. It is hard because sometimes our boyfriends are playing on different days, or even playing on the same day, and all of our priorities are obviously for them. But we always make an effort."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Keep Calm and Carry On: Hand Luggage Essentials" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/284e5a726633-collage-hfm-20.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Keep Calm and Carry On: Hand Luggage Essentials" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Keep Calm and Carry On: Hand Luggage Essentials</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="'Ozempic Face': The new cosmetic concern you should be aware of" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/26dcef193f65-hfm-try-the-trend-header-6.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="'Ozempic Face': The new cosmetic concern you should be aware of" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>'Ozempic Face': The new cosmetic concern you should be aware of</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e8hwoWND5kiR data-wc=50>"It's such a unique experience dating a tennis player. And there are certain things that we go through that a lot of people might not understand, just based on their schedule and things that come with the sport. So it's so nice to have other females that really understand that."</p><p id=eTB8eUUySKfr data-wc=50>During the tournaments, one thing that is always serving an ace is Paige’s outfits. Continuing to raise her fashion bar, she is now working with a stylist. "She's really pushed me out of my comfort zone in a really good way, and introduced me to some new designers," she explains.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/fc9967af1fc5-2.jpg><p id=ecSWcS6OQ1tu data-wc=51>"I'm so grateful to tennis, because I've become more into luxury and high-end designers through the sport. We’re continuing to build out what I'm doing in fashion and the impression that I'm going to be leaving. It's really like a collaborative process, and we have a lot of fun with it."</p><p id=ex6SCk3BZ4dh data-wc=79>Some of the fun includes dressing differently depending on where she is. "My stylist and I make a plan to work with designers from the places I’m going to. So, at Wimbledon this year, I'll be working with a London-based designer. It's definitely about dressing up for different occasions. The French Open is so different from Wimbledon, and I think because the slams are in major cities, it makes it easier to dress for the vibe of the location."</p><p id=ez_WZprnZs55 data-wc=52>She also likes to give her outfits a certain tennis twist. "I think my personal style in general has evolved a lot through tennis and these matches. I always say my personal style really reflects my interests and hobbies at that point in my life. So, I’ve leaned into that tennis look."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/ad02fed68038-7.jpg><p id=e3Oc6k25LLaO data-wc=69>Paige grew up in Connecticut, in southern New England, where she still lives, though she also has an apartment in LA, where her business is located. "I absolutely adore Connecticut. When I'm at my house, I like wearing my barn clothes. I love spending time outside with nature and my horses, especially because what I do is so public-facing. When I’m home, any issues feel small, it's very grounding."</p><p id=eTCAQg5i9aKV data-wc=70>From the age of six, Paige lived with a host family in Vermont, to enable her to attend a private ski racing academy. "Downhill skiing is a very niche sport that requires a certain level of dedication. My whole entire life was skiing. So the fact that Tommy's whole entire life is tennis..it makes sense to me. It's been really cool to be a part of someone else's athletic journey."</p><p id=ebUGp90s5yjK data-wc=87>Growing up surrounded by athletes has made a lasting impression on Paige. "I love a competitive environment, and when you are around athletes, the coolest person in the room is the one who works the hardest. It's not the prettiest person—it doesn’t have anything to do with vanity. It wasn’t even the person with the best grades. It was truly the person who, day in and day out, was the most dedicated, always raising the bar. If you had to run three laps, they would run six."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/portrait/5a4e87ce60dc-1-prada.jpg><figure class="HFMQuote_hd2j4x3 quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-editions-june-2024 -style-2"><p>"Now, tennis feels like it is for everyone"</p></figure><p id=ehDmxwCRtL5r data-wc=63>Continuing with her high achievements, Paige launched Dairy Boy in 2021. The name derives from a joke about her preference for traditional milk over alternatives. "A lot of them are fairly unhealthy, and I was kind of joking about how influencer culture has sort of taken over in the way that if they tell you that oatmeal is better for you, everyone listens."</p><p id=eOYpbctBlDIf data-wc=40>Through the joke, she began creating merch that evolved into a lifestyle brand, featuring categories such as sweats, T-shirts, and caps. Recently, Paige added to her repertoire, launching American Charm, which offers ‘country core’ interiors with a nostalgic vintage feel.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">More From The June Digital Issue:</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="My Fashion Fantasy: Nicky Hilton on escaping to Maui, her favourite Roman restaurant and where to shop" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b7605141685a-hfm-try-the-trend-header-5.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="My Fashion Fantasy: Nicky Hilton on escaping to Maui, her favourite Roman restaurant and where to shop" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>My Fashion Fantasy: Nicky Hilton on escaping to Maui, her favourite Roman restaurant and where to shop</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="The Radar: The OOO Edition" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/a32e16149bb9-collage-hfm-17.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="The Radar: The OOO Edition" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>The Radar: The OOO Edition</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eKqg7DMx9CMu data-wc=48>Before she leaves the meeting, I feel the need to tap her further about how now there is a much larger demographic following a sport that was once considered elitist.
