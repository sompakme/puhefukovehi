Now, hunky half Scottish-half Peruvian actor Henry Ian Cusick has joined the likes of former <i>EastEnder</i> Michelle Ryan and <i>ER</i> actress Parminder Nagra in taking his career to new heights with a key role in a hit US show, as <i>Lost</i>'s mysterious castaway Desmond.</p><p id=eH4n40mD_ctI data-wc=37>The handsome actor - who joined two of his co-stars to attend the opening party of a new Italian TV film festival this week - has emerged as one of the show's key players in series three.</p><p id=eKn3wJfLF_Xu data-wc=81>And it's not just viewers who've taken him to their hearts. Henry's strong bond with co-stars Jorge Garcia, who plays Hugo 'Hurley' Reyes and Terry O'Quinn, aka John Locke, was there for all to see this week as the trio stood side by side in the Italian capital. And even though Henry joined in season two - after he impressed bosses with an audition tape he sent from the UK - he seems just as much a part of the family.</p><p id=eNTuED8kryEj data-wc=79>The actor moved his family from London to the Hawaiian island of Oahu last summer when bosses confirmed he would take up a regular role in the series. And that wasn't the only life-changing event. He also tied the knot with Annie, his partner of 14 years - with whom he has three children, Eli, 13, Lucas, nine, and seven year-old Esau - as visa restrictions would have meant she could only stay for three months at a time.</p><p id=eerLhjwDNEXT data-wc=19>Henry and his fellow <i>Lost</i> stars will return to the jungle when they begin lensing series four in August.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
