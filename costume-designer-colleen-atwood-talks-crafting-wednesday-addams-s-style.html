We first caught glimpses of Wednesday Addams in the cartoons of famed illustrator Charles Addams in The New Yorker in 1938, and over the next 50 years, the character went through several iterations of film, television, and stage adaptations, culminating in perhaps the most memorable Christina Ricci performance in The Addams Family (1991) and Addams Family Values (1993)."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We’ve seen her burn down a summer camp, play with an antenna during a thunderstorm, and even shoot an arrow at an apple in her brother’s mouth—and we love her for it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We first caught glimpses of Wednesday Addams in the cartoons of famed illustrator Charles Addams in The New Yorker in 1938, and over the next 50 years, the character went through several iterations of film, television, and stage adaptations, culminating in perhaps the most memorable Christina Ricci performance in The Addams Family (1991) and Addams Family Values (1993). That is, until now, when Jenna Ortega takes her turn as the beloved antihero in Netflix’s new adaptation, Wednesday, directed by goth master Tim Burton and premiering on November 23.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s been more than 80 years since the world first met Wednesday Addams, and in that time, her look—as severe as her character—has changed surprisingly very little: black hair, often in very straight pigtails, and a perverse black schoolgirl dress with a contrasting white Peter Pan collar. The Wednesday we see in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a40909995/wednesday-addams-netflix-casting-release-date-rumors/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="this new Netflix adaptation" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">this new Netflix adaptation</a>, however, reaches new levels of complexity and Gen Z style—in no small part because of the work of costume design superstar and Academy Award winner Colleen Atwood, whose credits include Sleepy Hollow (1999), Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), Into the Woods (2014), Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018), and 2023’s forthcoming The Little Mermaid remake with Halle Bailey.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We catch up with Atwood to learn more about her process, how collaborating with Burton over the years has changed the way she sees the color black, and how she gave this new version of Wednesday a sense of levity and relatability in what at first blush appears to be a dark, twisted character.</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How did you approach inventing, or perhaps reinventing, this character who we’ve seen so many times?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It all started with the familiar Wednesday that we all know—with the little black dress. We made the collar a little more pointed, but the idea was to do an homage everyone would be familiar with. The series is set against the unusual backdrop of a bright, colorful American school, so she was immediately set apart from that by that look. So when we see her at school, that’s her uniform. But in her downtime, we were able to update her look and go a bit deeper into the character.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What kind of additions did you make?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In one of the early fittings, someone from hair and makeup had the great idea of putting freckles on her. It was this simple, genius thing, and we also did bangs with the braids. It’s a new look for Wednesday—much less cliché in a way. She’s always kind of had braids, but they were very tight, Victorian pigtail things, and we softened and contemporized it with those ideas. It also makes the character more vulnerable in a different way.</p><img alt="wednesday jenna ortega as wednesday addams in episode 101 of wednesday cr courtesy of netflix © 2022" title="wednesday jenna ortega as wednesday addams in episode 101 of wednesday cr courtesy of netflix © 2022" width=3600 height=1800 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wednesday-s1-e1-00-02-28-14r-1669056691.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>There’s a lot of black in these costumes, which can look rather flat onscreen, but the costumes you designed have a great visual depth to them. How did you achieve that?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Finding new blacks is always a tricky thing to do, but that’s the beauty of what we get to do. If you take black and give it a little something so that under the lighting, it becomes this richer black, it won’t go into this dark hole. Morticia’s dress, for instance, is all black. But I was playing around with this technique in all leather, and I twisted the dress so those side things take the solid black shape to another place and give it more life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And besides using black that was semi-reflective, I used black with white. There’s almost no solid black that’s used. If a character is in a black jacket, for instance, I pair it with a white shirt underneath so you can see the sleeve peek out at the cuff, so it’s not just a blob of black on the screen.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>You are a frequent collaborator of Tim Burton’s, and we often see his characters wearing black and white stripes. I’m thinking of The Nightmare Before Christmas, Beetlejuice, Sleepy Hollow. … There are also some great stripes in the show. Are those a challenge to get right?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When you see Tim’s drawings, he is a very graphic person. I think he just gravitates towards a stripe. I always try to play with it instead of just saying, “Oh, God, stripes again,” and instead trying different aspects and playing with different things to put some art into the stripe. For example, Wednesday’s uniform is gray and black stripes. Initially, I was looking for striped fabric, but it was so flat on camera. I like stripes that are irregular, and I notice that stripes look better on film if you shade them a bit so they’re less relentless. I developed a silk screen for the stripes for her that went from a light to a dark gray, so each stripe contained more than one color, which makes it a less flat surface.</p><img alt="wednesday l to r jenna ortega as wednesday addams, percy hynes white as xavier thorpe in episode 101 of wednesday cr vlad ciopleanetflix © 2022" title="wednesday l to r jenna ortega as wednesday addams, percy hynes white as xavier thorpe in episode 101 of wednesday cr vlad ciopleanetflix © 2022" width=3600 height=2400 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wednesday-101-unit-02280rc-1669061503.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What was the hardest look to get right?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The hardest part was the initial look of Wednesday’s family—paying homage but updating it. Morticia’s dress took me a minute. I made it in three or four different fabrics before I ended up. She’s what we call a “one-er,” because she only wears one costume onscreen.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Morticia’s hair is so striking onscreen, but looks quite lifelike. Was that wig a process?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wigs are always a process. In that case, the wig was pretty close in the first test, but we ended up making it straighter and thinning it out and making it look less wiggy, because in the humidity, the wig kept wanting to expand. The last thing you need in a shot is a big black wig.</p><img alt="wednesday l to r luis guzmán as gomez addams, catherine zeta jones as morticia addams, issac ordonez as pugsley addams in episode 105 of wednesday cr © 2022" title="wednesday l to r luis guzmán as gomez addams, catherine zeta jones as morticia addams, issac ordonez as pugsley addams in episode 105 of wednesday cr © 2022" width=3600 height=2394 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wednesday-105-unit-00921r-1669056659.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>How much of the costumes were created, and how much did you source from vintage or from costume houses, so forth?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The principle costumes I created, but I sourced a lot of vintage for the world around Wednesday. I pulled odd pieces from the ’60s and ’70s, more contemporary stuff. I didn’t want it to feel Victorian. My inspiration for Gwendoline Christie’s character was Tippi Hedren in The Birds. She’s just so fabulous that I wanted to do something special—so I decided on this pistachio suit.</p><img alt="wednesday gwendoline christie as larissa weems in episode 103 of wednesday cr vlad ciopleanetflix © 2022" title="wednesday gwendoline christie as larissa weems in episode 103 of wednesday cr vlad ciopleanetflix © 2022" width=3600 height=2394 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wednesday-103-unit-00522r-1669062087.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Netflix</span></p><h2 data-node-id=25 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>What was your favorite costume you “got right” for Wednesday?</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is a party dress that comes later in the season; it’s an Alaïa I found on a mannequin on Bond Street in London. I made my assistant put it on in the store. It’s this fabric that moves and does its job in such a great way, that you usually see on dance costumes. It has these sheer layers that have so much life, so it doesn’t just hang there like a chiffon dress. It moves really beautifully.</p><h2 data-node-id=27 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60"><strong>Lucky teenager that she gets to wear Alaïa to the prom!</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed.
