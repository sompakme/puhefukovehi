By Jonathan Klotz | Updated 9 months ago Our trusted and proven sources brought us another confirmed exclusive, as we can officially confirm that Donald Glover is in Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse as a live-action Aaron Davis, The Prowler. While it’s left unclear if he’s the exact same character from Spider-Man: Homecoming, or just another multiverse variant, the Community star is in the film wearing the villain’s traditional green and purple suit."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While it’s left unclear if he’s the exact same character from Spider-Man: Homecoming, or just another multiverse variant, the Community star is in the film wearing the villain’s traditional green and purple suit. Reprising the role, even as a variant, makes it more likely that when the live-action Miles Morales film is finally released, Glover will be the one playing the web-slinger’s uncle.</p><p>Aaron Davis as The Prowler was a major part of the first film in the animated trilogy, eventually killed by Wilson Fisk, the Kingpin when he decides to side with his heroic nephew. According to the published reports, this leads Miles Morales to stop and have a brief talk with Donald Glover’s Davis during a sequence set in a multidimensional prison. The pair exchange a few lines before Miles moves on, but the surprise Prowler cameo isn’t the only Easter egg in the scene.</p><p>The Spider-Man from the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=PlayStation data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>PlayStation</a> games, which also included a version of Aaron Davis as The Prowler, is locked up in prison as well, recognizable by the standout white spider on the traditional blue and red suit. Donald Glover didn’t voice the digital Davis, Ike Amandi did a fantastic job as the conflicted thief, but wherever there’s a Miles Morales, there’s his uncle in the same universe, which hopefully means the main <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=MCU data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>MCU</a> will eventually introduce Brooklyn Visions Academy’s best student.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/prowler-spider-verse-900x506.jpg><p>Donald Glover isn’t the only live-action star crossing over, as technically, Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield appear during montages, while <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title="Tom Holland" data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>Tom Holland</a> is noticeably absent. Across the Spider-Verse is only the first of a two-part story, though, which means there’s still an opportunity for the MCU’s Peter Parker to appear in the third film. As for other easter egg cameos, there are plenty, especially for long-time comic readers.</p><p>Just before Donald Glover’s appearance, Miles Morales comes upon Peter Parkedcar, the sentient Spider-Mobile that, according to his creator Dan Slott, comes from a Cars-like universe where automobiles have replaced humans. A Spider-Man T.Rex variant also makes an appearance, along with the classic 1968 Spider-Man from his original animated series, noted for the “Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man” meme, making his second appearance following Into The Spider-Verse’s post-credits scene.</p><p>Revealed earlier in a <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=television data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>television</a> trailer, the only other live-action cameo comes from Venom’s Mrs. Chen, played by Peggy Lu, though the <a class=wpil_keyword_link href=# rel=noopener title=alien data-wpil-keyword-link=linked>alien</a> symbiote and Tom Hardy are both sadly absent. Regardless of the lack of other live-action cameos, it’s amazing that Donald Glover is not only included but incorporated in such a way as to be notable and memorable. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is out now, with the follow-up, Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, currently slated for a March 24, 2024 release.</p><p>While we hope Donald Glover’s appearance means he’s returning to the MCU, for now, the accomplished star is going to be working on the Community movie, which will start filming whenever the Writer’s Guild of America ceases their strike.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Snq2icn6OurbCMoKOorpWnerS8yJ2cq2Wdlrtur8CmnKhmmKm6rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
