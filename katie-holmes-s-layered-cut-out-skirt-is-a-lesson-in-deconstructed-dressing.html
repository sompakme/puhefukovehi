Katie opened up about the “difficulties” of wearing several hats as she co-wrote, directed, and starred in the new flick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It’s difficult in the sense that you're wearing two hats, but your most important one on set is the director because you're leading the ship,” she told the publication. “When I stepped into being an actor, in my head, I was [more] aware of time. I was like, I actually have to get this in very few takes because I know what we have left to get tonight. I don't want to hold people up. I worked with an acting teacher prior to prepping the film. So I had my directions in my head for what I wanted to do.”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrop1dnbytucSsZJutpKm8r3nDqK6nZZyWxqa%2BxJ1knZ2TpLu0wNGumq2dlGLArLXRrWRwbGdug3GB</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
