The problem? She practiced on wooden floors, she said, only to discover the cathedral was carpeted.</p><p>"I had an immediate face-lift," Dion said.

We're married.'"</p><p>Dion explained that because the bump was "so huge," she made the executive decision to seek medical treatment.</p><p>"I'm like: 'Okay, let's go to the doctor,'" she added. "I had to be on antibiotics for about three weeks."</p><p>Despite her gorgeous and elaborate wedding tiara resulting in a hospital stay and a three-week antibiotic regiment, the musical icon says she wouldn't change a thing about her wedding day or her bridal ensemble.</p><p>"This is a moment that will be with me for the rest of my life," she told Vogue. "The dress couldn't have been big enough. I could've had three times the size on my head. I could've had six different dresses that night, because he was and he still is such a wonderful human being. He brought (out) the best of me. He really did."</p><p>Angélil was Dion's former manager, who first started working with the singer professionally when she was 12 years old, <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/music/celine-dion-rene-angelil-relationship-timeline/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>People reports</a>.
