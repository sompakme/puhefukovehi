To use the universally accepted metric of "how many Big Macs?", that's 7,543,520 Big Macs. It is also the bonus tied to Ja Morant's supermax rookie extension that he signed last year with the Memphis Grizzlies. Morant's contract totaled $192.2 million over 5 years. However, he could raise that figure by $39 million if he was named to an All-NBA team for the 2022-23 season. Last season, Morant was named to the All-NBA Second Team.</p><p>It didn't matter which All-NBA team he made in 2022-23, he just had to earn those consecutive honors. Morant played 61 games in the regular season, putting up 26.2 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 8.1 assists per game. While his scoring took a slight dip, it was a massive increase in terms of assists. He was 11th in scoring and 5th in assists across the entire league.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-morant-misses-out-on-all-nba-honors>Morant Misses Out On All-NBA Honors</h2></span><p>LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - APRIL 28: Ja Morant #12 of the Memphis Grizzlies warms up before play against the Los Angeles Lakers in Game Six of the Western Conference First Round Playoffs at Crypto.com Arena on April 28, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.

Of the 100 ballots issued for All-NBA voting, Morant received 10 second-team votes and 14 third-team votes. Second-team honors was always going to be a long shot. that list ended up being comprised of Jaylen Brown, Jimmy Butler, <a href=# class=text-word rel="nofollow noopener">Steph Curry</a>, Nikola Jokić, and Donovan Mitchell. Despite this, there was a strong case for Morant to get third-team honors.</p><p>But as Morant failed to break into even the third team (De'Aaron Fox, LeBron James, Damian Lillard, Julius Randle, Domantas Sabonis), his $39 million incentive bonus is voided. And honestly, that's just a little unfair. Sure he missed some games due to suspension, but he played a great season. Furthermore, it feels rigged against the player to hinge a bonus on something completely out of their control. Regardless, Morant will not receive his bonus based on not meeting his contractual obligation. How do you feel about the situation? Should Morant have gotten All-NBA honors?
