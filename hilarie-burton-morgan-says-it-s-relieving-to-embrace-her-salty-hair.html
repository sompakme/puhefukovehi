And there's plenty of meaning behind her decision to keep things natural. During a Saturday, October 7 appearance on&nbsp;The View, she discussed her decision to "grow it all out" after cohost Joy Behar called her hair "beautiful."</p><p>"It's a weird thing when you were a teen drama actress, and the expectation to be 17 forever is out there," she said. "I didn't necessarily like my younger years. I dealt with some dark stuff. So this idea that you can level up and get to the place where you're the salty one in the room was exciting to me."</p><p>Burton Morgan went on to name some of her gray-haired heroes, including Bea Arthur, Ruth Gordon, and Betty White. "That's who I wanted to be,” she said. “So going gray early was a relief."</p><p>In a separate essay <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.newbeauty.com/hilarie-burton-morgan-essay/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>previously published</a>, Burton Morgan noted that she first died her hair in middle school. Later, she was told she needed to bleach her hair to "look like a star,” causing a 2004 mullet moment after her locks fell out in chunks.&nbsp;After years spent hating the "costumed" feeling of hair dye and seeing her husband, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, embraced for his silver strands, she decided to give it a try herself.</p><p>"As my silver grew in, I liked how I looked-perhaps for the first time," she wrote. "I liked what it did to my eyes and skin tone." Of course, the soon-to-be-released&nbsp;Grimoire Girl&nbsp;author isn't the only one who likes the look.</p><p>In a September 2023 Instagram post, Burton Morgan shared a hair update and set of photos, noting that her colorist Amanda Guido mixed some ice blonde in with her grey. "Yes ma'am. Daddy like," commented her husband, adding a row of heart emojis and a sweet "always" sign-off.</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

(Even if I'm only 30!)" they wrote. May Hilarie’s passion for gray inspire us all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RopycpJGev6Z6wqikaJqVlsK1xY6hoKWZop6ybq7Uq6uopl2ivLOzwKdkoKqRrnqprcirZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
