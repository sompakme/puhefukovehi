He featured in a series of videos that made the rounds online. The videos are of himself hanging out on a boat with his new model girlfriend Paige Imani. They arrived through Imani's Instagram story. The couple have only been dating for a few weeks but things seem to be going pretty well. At least that's according to one move she made.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">That move was getting Ross' real name "William" tattooed on her. It's a move that pops up with alarming consistency online and normally doesn't go well. Seemingly for every story of a celebrity getting their partners name tatted on them, there's a story about a different celebrity getting an ex's name removed. Not to rain on Ross and Imani's parade as things seem to be going quite well for the pair so far. Check out the clips she shared of the pair living their best life together below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-rick-ross-girl-got-his-name-tattooed-on-her>Rick Ross' Girl Got His Name Tattooed On Her</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The boat party videos got extra attention in the wake of Ross' feud with <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>. He jumped onto an increasing pile of artists taking shots at the biggest name in hip-hop. He was one of the first to hit Drake with a full diss track following Kendrick throwing out just a few bars as a feature on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> & <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a>'s "Like That. ' Fans have been pretty critical of Ross' response to the situation, which didn't primarily involve him in the first place. He was criticized online for trying to make a beef that was between Kendrick and Drake about him instead. When Drake released a response track he mainly prioritized hitting back at Kendrick.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Rick Ross' new girlfriend getting his name tattooed on her after just a few weeks of dating?
