They are so, so different. But I hope to continue Queer Eye for a very very long time. I hope we get to make more of these. I will always make time for both of them, I love them both. They shoot at different times so that's not difficult. This only takes six weeks and Queer Eye takes five months."</p><p id=eC4l7UZ1fEr0 data-wc=1><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>21 best Netflix documentaries to watch in 2020</a></strong></p><p id=eSnHwzSO-liW data-wc=85>Alexa joked: "We could make it five months! Then we could sunbathe in between!" Tan agreed, joking that his time filming the show in LA was spent entirely indoors. "My friends thought we were living it up," he explained. "And I was like, 'No! We're in a dark space. We don't see the sun.'" The star clearly had the support of his&nbsp;co-stars on his new venture, as Bobby Berk and Jonathan Van Ness were both in the audience for the show's finale.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8abc4964737c-tan-alexa-nif-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e-x6tYMMeZRd data-wc=14><strong>Tan has teamed up with Alexa Chung for their new show Next in Fashion</strong></p><p id=eg1Oajt5-y9w data-wc=98>Tan said: "It was really weird the finale, because I'm in this very unique situation with just Alexa. You know when you're a kid and you're in a play or whatever, then you see your parents in the audience and it's like, 'Woah, my two worlds colliding!' It was so lovely that they turned out, so, so lovely. I wish the other boys could have been there we all work so crazily, and that day we were shooting the Taylor Swift video, so Karamo and Antoni were filming their scenes at that time so they couldn't be there."&nbsp;</p><p id=ejoehkTHDkmr data-wc=1><strong>READ:<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;30 TV shows to get excited about in 2020</a></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
