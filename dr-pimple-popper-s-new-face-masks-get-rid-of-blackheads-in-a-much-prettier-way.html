Lee collaborated with Dermovia, the brand behind the Compression Lace Face Mask you've probably seen on Instagram at some point, on a set of <a data-offer-url=https://www.dermovia.com/products/lace-your-face-x-dr-pimple-popper-clear-complexion-kit class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dermovia.com/products/lace-your-face-x-dr-pimple-popper-clear-complexion-kit"}' href=# rel=noopener>four different masks</a> that claim to deliver impeccable skin in four weeks, via ingredients that tackle your problems and build on each prior week's benefits. The first mask concentrates on exfoliating, the second on clarifying, the third on healing, and the fourth on brightening. The end game? Skin that'll never land you in Dr. Pimple Popper's office.</p><p>As a career masker, I bypassed reading the directions (a mistake). Putting it on your face is pretty straightforward, but the mask's ear and chin straps take a minute to loop around your ears. It's worth it, though—no more holding your phone above your face to do something, anything, while keeping a slippery sheet mask in place. On the skin benefits side, the up close and personal fit means the ingredients penetrate even better; on the life benefits side, it's pretty difficult to keep a straight face while you're fastening the chin-to-ear straps, so I'll take that minute of joy.</p><p>Once on, you could sit back and let the active ingredients do their job, or you could take your newfound mobility and clean your bathroom (or, you know, do anything). As a hero, I cleaned for four minutes — and it stayed on with flying colours. Twenty-six minutes of looking at my computer later, and I peeled the lace off and rubbed the essence in. I glistened like a fictional sea creature. It was great.</p><p>The next morning, my skin looked brighter, more even, and plump (although, I've been in a good place with my skin recently thanks to this retinol trick.) Still, the mask's exfoliating enzymes, glycerin, collagen, and sea water extract weren't for nothing, and I'll be sticking with the next three for the full ride. On that note, it's just nice to have a mask tell you what the next month of your life will look like. It has a plan! It was made by a doctor. I'm all in.</p><p>Lace Your Face x Dr. Pimple Popper Clear Complexion Kit, $55, <a data-offer-url=https://www.dermovia.com/products/lace-your-face-x-dr-pimple-popper-clear-complexion-kit class=external-link data-event-click='{"element":"ExternalLink","outgoingURL":"https://www.dermovia.com/products/lace-your-face-x-dr-pimple-popper-clear-complexion-kit"}' href=# rel=noopener>dermovia.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLjApqauqp2WtKLGyKecZ5ufY8Kse8Crq6KbnJp8pb6MqaCmqJyaerG7z6mcq2WemsRussCcnGalkai4tHnBpZico5iarqW%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
