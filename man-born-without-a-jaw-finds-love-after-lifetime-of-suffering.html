He was taken to Chicago for multiple maxillofacial surgeries when he was only a few days old.</p><p>"Growing up was hard and being born like this has caused me many problems, but I have tried not to let it affect me," he said.</p><p>Today, Williams vows that his physical condition will not prevent him from living his life to the fullest with Vania, and his plans include a passion for drumming and sharing music.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3RnJhnm5%2BifKa6jqWgn52jqcatsY6wpquklGK7psPSaGlpamJkfXZ7kWtmb2poloGnrZRtbWpuY5uwd63DcZltbZJoe6nAzKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
