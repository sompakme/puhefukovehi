When he loses them he finds himself at his high school track. He thinks he sees an old neighbor and true to talk to him but realizes that the neighbor is like a ghost. Then the man remembers the last time he saw that neighbor, he accidentally hit him with his car, killing him. Thinking he could apologize for what he did, the man said sorry. The ghost looked at him and said, 'Run'</p><p>The young man then heard a noise and saw a bunch of spirts of people he betrayed, cheated, and lied to. He then went around the track apologizing to everyone and having flashbacks of all of his wrong doings, making sending them down the path of death or the path of anti-social or the path to the worst life ever. When he was done he tried to find his neighbor to ask him what to do next, but the neighbor was gone and all the sprits were clustering together and now running. The young man, finding it hard to go against them, ran with them. Then he heard a cop car siren but dud nothing about it.</p><p>He was too mesmerized to even stop to get off the track let alone think. He hears the cop car stop, doors open and guns cock yet he still ran with the crowd. He heard the cops telling but ignored them. Soon the sprits speed slacken and their run turned back to a walk. That's when the young man really noticed the cops but walked with the sprits like he was one of them. It wasn't until he felt a sharp pain in his back and his feet trip over one another making him fall that he realized that regrets can really come back to bit you in the butt. But before his eyes closed for the last time, he saw his neighbor, he ran over with his car, shacking his head mumbling, 'What have you done' then walking away.<br>And those words stuck in his head until he closed his eyes, watching ghost feet walk on him like he was apart of the track.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rcXRopqipqSav7G%2BxK2YraGfo8Bvr86mZpynnJm9ra3YaKurp6WXuaY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
