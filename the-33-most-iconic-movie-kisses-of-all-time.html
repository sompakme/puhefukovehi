It's still captivating to see him woo Kate Winslet's Rose, even if, as DiCaprio <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>said in an interview</a>, kissing Kate is "like kissing a family member."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-moonlight></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Moonlight</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>A24</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The movie may have won Best Picture at the 2017 Oscars, but let's not forget that the beach moment shared between Chiron (Ashton Sanders) and Kevin (Jharrel Jerome) nabbed Best Kiss at the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>MTV Movie and TV Awards</a>.

First, the two practice on the arms and then lean in for the real thing — it's too cute. But according to Culkin, he didn't want to do the kiss.

(For one thing, he'd wanted <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Marilyn Monroe</a> to play Holly Golightly.) But audiences adored this stylish film, particularly for the final scene, in which Holly (Audrey Hepburn) and Paul (George Peppard) make a rainy New York City alley seem as romantic as any pink-streaked sunset.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-to-all-the-boys-ive-loved-before></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>To All the Boys I've Loved Before</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Netflix</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you find yourself longing for the simplicity that came along with youthful relationships (no talk of marriage and biological clocks), then you'll want to check out To All the Boys I've Loved Before, based on the book by the same name by Jenny Han.

So when she does, it's pivotal — the audience understands that she's come to regard Edward as much more than a client. But even that kiss can't beat the one at the happy ending after Edward "rescues" Vivian on her fire escape and she promises to "rescue him right back."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ghost></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ghost</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Paramount/Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Technically, in this scene from the 1990 film, Molly Jensen (<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Demi Moore</a>) is making out with Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg).

I'm still free." But, as this 1993 adaptation of the Edith Wharton classic illustrates, no one was really free in 1870s New York society.

But it's great fun to imagine a young William Shakespeare (played by Joseph Fiennes) falling in love with a merchant's daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow) as he writes his romantic tragedy, Romeo and Juliet. Ultimately, the lovers must part, but not before sharing a passionate backstage adieu.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-west-side-story></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>West Side Story</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_61-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-low-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy Everett Collection</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_62-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In this 1961 musical update of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer played the star-crossed pair.

But that's only the beginning of a tempestuous relationship that spans a decade and a half as both pursue professional athletic careers.

"The whole time I had rainwater running up my nose," he said.
