Grass hay falls short of meeting the nutrient requirements of high production life stages, but is an excellent filler for horses that require bulk in the diet.<h2>Can you feed only alfalfa?</h2>Generally alfalfa is a good hay to feed horses, but there are caveats: Don't overfeed alfalfa. Only feed alfalfa if your horse needs extra digestible energy, protein, and calcium.<h2>How much alfalfa can you feed a horse?</h2>Horses can normally eat 1.5-2% of their body weight in hay, which equates to 18-24 lbs. of hay per day. The quality of the hay will determine how much is needed and if supplemental grain should be added.<h2>Can horses eat standing alfalfa?</h2>Alfalfa can be grazed as a single-species or mixed with grass. Red or white clover doesn't regrow well when grazed by horses, so it's best to mix with grass. Alfalfa and red clover can be appropriate pasture species for horses diagnosed with metabolic disorders.<h2>Ask the Vet - Why you shouldn't feed alfalfa exclusively</h2><p></p><h2>Can horses eat wet alfalfa?</h2>Wet hay typically goes through a fermentative state, of sorts, and it would not be good for the horse to eat it while this was happening,” she continued. Caution should be used in purchasing hay that was wet when baled. Too much moisture affects the quality of baled hay.<h2>Does alfalfa cause colic in horses?</h2>Rich alfalfa hay can also cause colic, so we recommend feeding a grass hay or grass/alfalfa mix. Changes in management or a horse's routine can be stressful and contribute to colic risk as well. Water is also very important, as a horse with minimal exercise needs to drink 4-5 gallons a day to remain healthy.<h2>Does alfalfa make a horse hot?</h2>Alfalfa hay will make a horse hot, or crazy.<p>Not so, if fed appropriately. Alfalfa provides a significant amount of calories; however, an excess of calories in any form, whether from alfalfa, grain or oil, without the exercise to burn them, can result in an excessively energetic horse.</p><h2>Does alfalfa cause inflammation in horses?</h2>THREE RISKS OF FEEDING TOO MUCH ALFALFA TO HORSES:<p>Horses that are on high protein diets become overly acidic which can cause inflammation in various body systems including the joints and hooves. They may get “hot”, anxious or agitated, or show signs of liver or kidney stress.</p><h2>Can you free feed alfalfa to horses?</h2>Alfalfa or grain hays (such as oat or rye) can be fed free choice too, and most horses will probably regulate their intake of these as well. But there are some problems with these. Alfalfa and oat hays are often somewhat higher in calories so will put weight on many horses.<h2>Does alfalfa cause ulcers in horses?</h2>Two recently published studies reported that feeding alfalfa chaff increased the incidence and/ or severity of glandular ulcers.<h2>Can alfalfa make horses itchy?</h2>We often find that Barley, Molasses and Alfalfa are ingredients that can cause unwanted reactions in some horses. For some horses, allergies and intolerances can take weeks, months or years to develop, meaning that their once favourite food could begin to cause unwanted and adverse reactions.<h2>Which cutting of alfalfa is best for horses?</h2>The most common choice of hay is second cutting, but first cutting is also good for horses, plus it is usually cheaper than the other two. Choose hay that is soft, green, and leafy, with thin stems, so it is easier for horses to eat.<h2>What to feed horses when there is no hay?</h2><p>Six Hay Alternatives for Horses</p><ul><li>Bagged chopped forage. It can replace all of your horse's hay, if necessary.</li><li>Hay cubes. Chopped cubed hay (usually alfalfa or timothy or a combination) is another 100-percent replacement. ...</li><li>Hay pellets. ...</li><li>“Complete” feed. ...</li><li>Beet pulp. ...</li><li>Soybean hulls.</li></ul><h2>What is the most nutritious hay for horses?</h2>Legume Hay for Horses<p>Alfalfa, white clover, red clover and birdsfoot trefoil are common types of legumes, with alfalfa being the most popular choice. Benefits: Legumes are higher in protein and calcium than grass hay, and may also provide more energy and a higher level of total digestible nutrients, such as vitamin A.</p><h2>Is grass hay or alfalfa better for horses?</h2>Grass hay typically has lower nutritional values than alfalfa hay, and is also lower in calcium, making it closer to a more desirable Ca:P. ratio (between 3:1 to 1:1). Also, grass hay is often less dusty than alfalfa hay, so it a good choice for horses that have respiratory issues.<h2>Is timothy hay or alfalfa better for horses?</h2>Alfalfa hay is typically higher in protein and essential nutrients than timothy hay, making Alfalfa a better option for more active animals that need a high protein diet. Alfalfa also has more calories per pound than timothy, so it's generally the preferred choice of sport horse owners.<h2>Which is better alfalfa cubes or pellets?</h2>There is no nutritional difference between alfalfa pellets and cubes, so the choice between the two is based on which type your horses prefer and which you prefer to feed and store. Alfalfa pellets, cubes, and hay provide the same essential nutrients per pound.<h2>Is alfalfa safe for laminitis?</h2>Due to it's low starch and sugar content alfalfa is ideal for laminitis prone horses or ponies and those with muscle problems. When shopping for horse feed, look out for our 'No Added Sugar' logo to be sure you are using the lowest sugar options available.<h2>Does alfalfa make horses pee more?</h2>Because alfalfa is high in protein and because excess protein will normally be converted to urea, a horse that gets more than its share will urinate more than usual.<h2>Is alfalfa good for senior horses?</h2>Therefore, the key to feeding older horses is to use high quality protein from sources like alfalfa, soybean meal and canola meal without oversupplying their requirements.<h2>Does alfalfa cause bladder stones in horses?</h2>Although it's not known why horses develop bladder stones, one theory is that high levels of calcium in a horse's diet may contribute to the problem, and alfalfa contains significantly more of that mineral than grass hays.<h2>Can you feed hay straight off the field?</h2>In perfect conditions — where the hay has been baled at less than 12% moisture and is very dry — it is safe to feed straight away, but this isn't often the case, Tim explains: “The main reason for allowing a period of anywhere between two and eight weeks before feeding freshly made hay is to allow for a process called ...<h2>Can you soak alfalfa hay?</h2>Alfalfa and orchardgrass need to soak for 60 minutes to reduce K to recommended levels prior to feeding HYPP horses. While soaking reduces K, neither alfalfa or orchardgrass is a good option for HYPP horses.<h2>How long should you soak horse hay?</h2>Soak hay for 30 to 60 minutes to reduce the sugar it contains. Don't soak the hay longer or you'll risk leaching beneficial nutrients. Soaking hay to remove sugars that can exacerbate metabolic conditions such as insulin resistance takes more time.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8KapWaxn6p6p7HEnWSaZZikv7SxjKyrq5mZnLW1ecClnZqklpY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
