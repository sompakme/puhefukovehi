The pair seemed to have a love-hate thing going on, and at the time, Cardi was an aspiring artist moving from the strip club to the microphone. She enlisted help from her industry contacts, including famed Power 105.1 radio host DJ Self. However, on-screen, it looked as if they were mixing business with pleasure, and it was suggested that Self made promises to help Cardi's career by playing her tracks on the radio.</p><p>The unscripted series followed the storyline as it unraveled. Cardi was frustrated because Self wasn't fulfilling his oaths, and in the end, they went their separate ways. Obviously, Self's apprehension didn't stop the <a href=# rel>"WAP" hitmaker </a>from pushing forward, even eventually earning herself her first Grammy. In an interview with My Expert Opinion, Self speaks on his relationship with the Rap star.</p><span><h2 id=h-did-dj-self-discover-cardi-b>Did DJ Self Discover Cardi B?</h2></span><p>CHANDLER, ARIZONA - FEBRUARY 11: Cardi B performs at Cardi B and Offset Headline Hall of Fame Party 2023 at Gila River Resorts & Casinos - Wild Horse Pass on February 11, 2023 in Chandler, Arizona. (Photo by Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for Capture Studio Group)</p><p>For a moment, the conversation shifted to whether or not Self believes he's responsible for discovering Cardi. “When you use that word discover, that’s a strong word with discover,” the DJ stated. “You can’t discover something that is there. I put the magnifying glass on her.” Elsewhere, Self said that Cardi didn't thank her for his help but admitted that he may not have done anything for her music career.</p><p>The My Expert Opinion hosts seemed confused about why Cardi wouldn't thank him. “I put her on television. I didn’t put her in a record deal," said Self. Still, the hosts believed that he opened up a platform for her to be visible <a href=# rel>on a famed franchise</a>, thus setting her up for success.</p><span><h2>Cardi Calls Love & Hip Hop Storyline Fake</h2></span><p>Back in 2018, while discussing Love & Hip Hop, Cardi told her Instagram followers that her storyline with Self was fake. The rapper admitted that the controversy was all for ratings, but it didn't come as a surprise. Although these shows are categorized as "reality," the industry has long touted them as "unscripted." This means most of the time, they're given a storyline that they improvise during filming. Check out DJ Self above and see what he says about <a href=# class=text-word rel>Jim Jones</a> being the only artist to thank him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaX52gZVmm6Nlo5q5p3nAp6qwnaKoeqqyjKGcZqyYnrusv4yhnGacmaiwsMLEq5ydZZOWv6W1jJtkrJmpqHq0tMRmpZ6ulad6tbTAp6KenF2dtq4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
