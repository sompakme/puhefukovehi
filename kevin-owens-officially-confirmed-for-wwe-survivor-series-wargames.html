The Honorary Uce said The Bloodline will win the Men’s WarGames match at Survivor Series. Sheamus responded that Sami Zayn wouldn’t like their pick for the fifth member.</p><p>Sami Zayn faced BUTCH in the first-round matchup for the World Cup Tournament in the main event. BUTCH got the win, but was immediately attacked by Solo Sikoa after the match. Roman Reigns arrived and took care of business, only to face a returning Kevin Owens inside the ring.</p><p>The two brawled until KO got his attention towards Sami Zayn. The distraction allowed The Tribal Chief to level KO with a Superman Punch. Reigns, however, failed to hit the spear as Owens hit him with a knee to the face, followed by a stunner. The main event for Survivor WarGames is now set.</p><p>Kevin Owens’ entry into the Men’s WarGames wasn’t previously confirmed because of his injury status. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The former Universal Champion suffered an MCL tear</a> during during the WWE Sunday Night Stunner house show in Madison, Wisconsin on November 13, 2022.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Owens is advertised for the go-home edition of SmackDown </a>for Survivor Series next week as well. We’ll have to wait to see what KO will do to The Bloodline and Sami Zayn when he joins hands with McIntyre and The Brawling Brutes next Saturday.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p><strong>What’s your take on this story?
