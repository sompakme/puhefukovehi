One of the climbers who received the brunt of the criticism was double amputee Mark Inglis, who was himself suffering from severe frostbite and had to be partially carried down the mountain by his Sherpas — and yet, the public was outraged that he hadn't stopped to help.</p><p>Sharp was climbing Everest solo, with insufficient oxygen, no Sherpa companions, and no radio. That didn't make him any less worthy of help, but it does explain why he was dying alone in Green Boots' cave. Still, Sharp's death is seen by many as one of Everest's most shameful moments, an example of how in the death zone it's frequently every climber for himself.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9lG1paWtfnbKzsdJmrqGxXaWysLzLnmSknZWleqXFyKeeZqeeYrqwwc2tZJ6ulaeytMCO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
