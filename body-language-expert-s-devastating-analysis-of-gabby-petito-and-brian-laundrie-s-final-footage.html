He exclusively told Nicki Swift that since the footage showed how they spent a long time in the vehicle, their "focus is not with the job of shopping but internally to whatever is happening inside the vehicle."</p><p>Bowden pointed out that there may be "potential indecision" with regard to shopping, at least in Laundrie's case, and that his "aggressive" slamming of the door looks "premeditated to make a point to Petito." The act itself served as a "consciously aggressive punctuation to whatever has gone on inside," said Bowden. Meanwhile, the fact that Petito rubbed her arm and swayed from side to side entering the store may have signaled "potential anxiety," and her holding the door open for Laundrie was some "anxious appeasement" to lighten his mood. Bowden found her behavior also suggested that Laundrie's aggression was "not unusual for her," but rather something she felt she needed to manage.</p><p>Bowden's analysis is not far off from what Petito's friends had said about <a href=#>her relationship with Laundrie</a>. Rose Davis, Petito's best friend, once told <a href=#>People</a> that they were "very toxic," with Laundrie having "apparent" jealousy issues. In a <a href=#>separate interview</a> with the outlet, Laundrie's friend, Ben Matula, said there was more to their relationship than meets the eye, recalling, "There was always something below the surface where things weren't 100% wonderful."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamhmaYR5go6bpp2xXaGur7PUmp6eZZWtvaa%2B06xknZ2mlsC1rdOipaBlkaOurcXSoqpmp5ZitKKuwbJkqZ2knsGwecCnm2aaop6ur3nLmqynnKKesrR5xaKlmqRdm7ywwMCgnGadqJi5tr%2FIr5xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
