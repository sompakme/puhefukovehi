The singer caused a stir last week after name-dropping other female artists, most of whom are women of color, for landing hits about “being sexy” and “wearing no clothes” as she addressed accusations that she “glamorizes abuse” in her music.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In Monday’s six-minute video, Del Rey explains that her original post was meant to highlight “the need for fragility in the feminist movement” and women who might be subject to victim-blaming for embracing their sexuality.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“And when I say ‘women who look like me’ I didn’t mean white like me, I mean the kind of women who, you know, other people might not believe because people think, ‘Look at her, she fuckin’ deserves it’ or whatever,” she says. “There’s a lot of people like that, you know?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Del Rey adds, “I just think it’s sad about the women I mentioned, whether they sing about dancing for money or whatever—the same stuff, by the way, that I’ve been singing about, chronicling for 13 years, that’s why I’m in that echelon, yes, they are my friends and peers and contemporaries—the difference is that when I get on the pole, people call me a whore, but when [FKA] Twigs <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a30669632/fka-twigs-pole-dancing-prince-tribute-grammys-2020/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="gets on the pole" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">gets on the pole</a>, it’s art.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also calls out the commenters who “want to turn my advocacy for fragility into a race war—it’s really bad.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Read more about the singer’s original statements below.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-1gns81k emevuu60">Update, 5/21, 6:40 p.m.:</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="body-dropcap css-udyf5a emevuu60">Hours after her original post made headlines, Lana Del Rey responded to the backlash surrounding her much-talked-about statement with a few updates on Instagram. Among them was a video compilation of herself pole dancing with the hashtag "#fuckoff" in the caption.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And on her Instagram Story, the singer also posted screenshots of two replies she wrote in her comments. In the first message, she addressed claims that she was trying to take away from the success of several women of color in music. In her original post, Del Rey had name-dropped artists including Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj, Kehlani, Doja Cat, Cardi B, and Camila Cabello for landing number-one songs “about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating, etc” while she was criticized for “glamorizing abuse.”</p>“Bro. This is sad to make it about a WOC issue when I’m talking about my favorite singers. I could’ve literally said anyone but I picked my favorite fucking people. And this is the problem with society today, not everything is about whatever you want it to be. It’s exactly the point of my post—there are certain women that culture doesn’t want to have a voice and it may not have to do with race I don’t know what it has to do with. Id on’t dare anymore but don’t ever ever ever ever bro—call me racist because that is bullshit.”<img alt="lana del rey instagram" title="lana del rey instagram" width=750 height=1334 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-0980-png-1590100123.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Lana Del Rey / Instagram</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In a follow-up post, she further denied accusations of racism.</p>“When I said people who look like me—I meant the people who don’t look strong or necessarily smart, or like they’e in control etc. It’s about advocating for a more delicate personality, not for white woman—thanks for the Karen comments tho.

All the other artists that Del Rey named have scored number one hits in recent years except Kehlani, according to her <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.billboard.com/music/kehlani/chart-history data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Billboard history" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Billboard history</a>.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Del Rey's opening statement was her most contentious, as readers promptly noticed that the artists she named were mostly women of color. Some questioned whether it was necessary for the singer to even name names, and others defended these artists for embracing sexuality in their music—something women, especially women of color, are often chastised for doing.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The focus of Del Rey's message, however, was the flak she's received for seemingly romanticizing abuse in her past work, when in fact, her material is drawn from real experiences, she said.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I'm fed up with female writers and alt singers saying that I glamorize abuse when in reality I'm just a glamorous person singing about the realities of what we are all now seeing are very prevalent emotionally abusive relationships all around the world," Del Rey continued. She added that it's "pathetic" the occasional lyrics that detail her "sometimes submissive or passive roles" in past relationships have "often made people say I've set women back hundreds of years."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Lyrics in question may include her 2014 song "Ultraviolence," which <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://genius.com/Lana-del-rey-ultraviolence-lyrics data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="has the lines" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">has the lines</a>, "I can hear sirens, sirens / He hit me and it felt like a kiss" (which quotes a 1962 song by The Crystals), and, "I can hear violins, violins / Give me all of that ultraviolence." A piece at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://time.com/2823016/lana-del-rey-ultraviolence-title-track/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=TIME class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">TIME</a> questioned whether the song glorified domestic violence; another at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.mic.com/articles/92775/lana-del-rey-is-a-huge-step-backwards-for-women-everywhere data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Mic class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Mic</a> said the singer "is a huge step backwards for women everywhere"; another from <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2014/06/20/323943849/darkness-comes-alive-the-paradox-of-lana-del-rey data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=NPR class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">NPR</a> said she "romanticizes destructive forces."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Del Rey explained that she's not against feminism ("I'm not not a feminist")—although she's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.thefader.com/2014/06/04/cover-story-lana-del-rey-is-anyone-she-wants-to-be data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="previously said" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">previously said</a> that she's "not interested" in the topic—and added that there should be a place in the movement for people with experiences like hers: "The kind of woman who says no but men hear yes - the kind of women who are slated mercilessly for being authentic, delicate selves, the kind of women who get their own stories and voices taken away from them by stronger women or by men who hate women."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She added that she's been "honest and optimistic" about her challenging past relationships, which may also be the case with many other people. Del Rey wrote that she feels her work has helped her "[pave] the way for other women" to be open about sadness and vulnerability in their music, even though she was "deemed literally hysterical as though it was literally the 1920s" for her first two records.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Del Rey ended her message with an announcement that she's releasing two new poetry books, whose proceeds will benefit Native American foundations of her choice. Del Rey will also drop a new album on September 5, which follows her 2019 LP, Norman Fucking Rockwell, and 2017's <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a10276942/lana-del-rey-lust-for-life-new-album/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lust for Life" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Lust for Life</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This post has been updated.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1667409691.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" title="Headshot of Erica Gonzales" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
