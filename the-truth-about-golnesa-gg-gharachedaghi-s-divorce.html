I did something to make someone else happy and I completely regretted it afterwards," she confessed. "I knew what I did was wrong and it wasn't for me or for my happiness, but for someone else, and I guess for one moment I thought maybe someone else's happiness will do it for me. And it didn't." It was something that Shalom just could never wrap his head around.&nbsp;</p><p>Gharachedaghi explained on "<a href=#>Watch What Happens Live</a>" that Yeroushalm&nbsp;"decided to go" the legal route and come for <a href=#>her money "and stuff,</a>" given that there was no prenup. She added that she thinks he wouldn't have gone as "hard" had she returned the engagement ring he gave her. At one point, she said she offered to return the ring if he would just sign the divorce papers and a non-disclosure agreement, but he refused. In 2021, Gharachedaghi told <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a> that she and Yeroushalm ran into each other and went to dinner but that she started to see "past behaviors" come out and broke it off again.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlgbH94e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2cvK26xKyYZp%2BXYrSprdGamqGdlJa0qbXSZpuirp%2BnsKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
