closer to Taylor.</p><p>He yelled: “You know what!”</p><p>Ryan jumped off the couch towards Larry as both wives held them back.</p><p>Jen and Maci grabbed their husband’s arms and tried to pull them

exclusively<a href=#> told The Sun </a>that he was demanding the network to pay him for his appearance after being on the reality show's trailer.</p><p>He told The Sun: “They just better pay me."</p><p>He explained: “MTV just stands for a lot of things that my wife and I don’t support, politics and respecting people’s rights, that kind of stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>“I just don’t agree with them on a lot of stuff and I didn’t want to work for some place that was like that anymore, they were just way too far out there for me."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read
