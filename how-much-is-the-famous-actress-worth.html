King described Parker as "number one," before explaining, "Kim was not at the height of her career, Kristin [Davis] was under her in terms of notability, Cynthia [Nixon] was a theater actress and their contracts reflected that status."&nbsp;</p><p>With time, everyone started to make more money, but Parker always had the biggest paycheck, with King remarking, "I guess for Kim it didn't matter how much the raise became if there was never parity, but there was never going to be parity."</p><p>However, Cattrall pulled in plenty of money from other acting roles and endorsements, including an <a href=#>Olay</a> campaign in 2011 and commercials for <a href=#>Nintendo</a>, <a href=#>Pepsi One</a>, and <a href=#>Nissan</a>, among others. Throughout her decades in the public eye, Cattrall has a net worth estimated at $60 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Sure, Parker&nbsp;technically&nbsp;starred in&nbsp;SATC, but Samantha's storylines always churned out the most interesting conversation among the fans. Yes, Cattrall is missing out on a chance to increase her net worth by not partaking in the revival, but sometimes it's good to leave people wanting more, and Samantha Jones will certainly be missed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGlga4R0e8qipGabkanBs63LpapmppWperi70a2fZqCfrHquwcKhZKKrXam1pnnFmqSoraNirqTA0Z6qrGWnpL%2B1tI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
