The palace's resident badass played by Alexandra Park let her rebellious personality spill over into her fashion choices, wearing bold ensembles, no matter the occasion. Whether she was attending a regal ball or heading out on a charity tour, we fell hard for Eleanor’s wardrobe—and so did Park. “It’s a dream to be able to dress up like that at work,” the star told <i>InStyle </i>earlier this week when we chatted with her about season two, which premieres Sunday, Nov. 15, at 10 p.m. ET on E!</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But while Park enjoys playing dress-up, she admits that her character’s fashion sense is a bit more out there than her own. “I just love Eleanor’s everyday outfits, because they’re things that I've always dared to wear but never really would,” she said. And the princess won’t be toning things down anytime soon. We already got a glimpse of her season two style in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>an exclusive clip</a> that shows Eleanor wearing a bright red skirt with a paneled sheer black top to a polo match in Sunday’s episode. “That was really cool,” Park said of the far-from-preppy outfit. “The polo match was very fun [to film].”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It also sets the tone for Eleanor’s fashion game this season—and you can expect the princess’s new pop of color to stick around. “She adds a little red in season two,” said Park. “Eleanor doesn’t really wear anything other than black, but now there’s a couple splashes of red.” For one scene later on this season, Eleanor even decks herself out in a whole slew of shades. “She wears a pretty outrageous outfit at one point in the season to make a statement about something,” said Park. “It’s a bright, rainbow dress.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That’s not the only piece in Eleanor’s closet that has caught Park’s attention. “There’s this Diesel jacket I wear that’s completely embellished with studs,” she said. “It’s really heavy—and it’s one of my favorite pieces.” It may be one of the tamer ones, too. But Eleanor’s wild style is just another facet that prove she’s not your average royal—something that Park was determined to have come across. “I wasn’t taking ideas or inspiration from any real life or made up princesses,” she said. “I just hope the reason that people connect with Eleanor is that she’s a real person—because to me, that’s the most important part.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And the princess has no interest in being perfect, either. “She makes mistakes,” said Park. “She’s flawed. She’s very vulnerable. She’s struggling and trying to figure out who she is, and I think most people can relate to those emotions.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Season two of The Royals premieres Sunday, Nov. 15, at 10 p.m. ET on E!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGeipMaiuNJmqq2ZomKurbHXmqWdqpFivaK%2BymagZq%2BRqHqiuNaasKxllJa%2FprCMsJyaql2kwrWyyK2qZqiinruksdKsZJ6klZa7sL4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
