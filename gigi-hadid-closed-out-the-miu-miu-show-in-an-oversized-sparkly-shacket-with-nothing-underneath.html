Gigi is to the runways what Travis Kelce is to the football field (it's called Swiftie math). So, while Gigi's <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bestie TSwift and their other friends</a> were watching Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs dominate the turf on Sunday, the super model had about an excuse that was pretty much as good as it gets in terms of missing a friend's football festivities.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Tuesday, Gigi walked in not one but two major fashion houses' Spring Summer 2024 shows, all in one day. Gigi stole the show at Miu Miu in a sparkly brown shacket and a matching pleated skirt that hit right below her knees. While she let her electric blue briefs peek out of her skirt waistband (a recurring motif in the brand's repertoire), she opted to wear nothing under her unbuttoned jacket. She accessorized with square specs, and her blonde hair was styled in a messy wet-looking updo.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gigi closed out the finale alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Priscilla</a> star Cailee Spaeny, who wore an oversized brown trench coat, which she held closed, covering her minidress.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier in the day, the famous model also appeared in Chanel's show at the Grand Palais Ephémèr, during which she wore a very shimmery jacket and trouser set accessorized with a chain belt, a necklace, and earrings all in geometric shapes.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Her blonde hair was worn down in crimped waves and a middle part and her minimalistic glam included bronzy cheeks and a pink lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before jetting off to Paris to receive fashion month's MVP award, Hadid walked in Versace's mod show in Milan. She wore a pale yellow-green dress with a swooping cowl neck. Her blonde hair was worn in a high half ponytail held in place by a bow-shaped accessory.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xqKeomWYlrGqsIymoK5lnZ7Cbr%2FHmpqknaRivaK%2ByKxkn5mjnbawuoywnJ6jXW2AdYORcG4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
