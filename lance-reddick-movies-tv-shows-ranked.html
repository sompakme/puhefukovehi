His range, intensity, and presence on-screen had no rival. He brought a unique power to his work that made him stand out in every performance. His depth of character always seemed genuine, allowing him to inhabit any role easily. It was his gift to transform what could have been bland, one-dimensional characters into something so much more that truly <a href=# rel>set Lance Reddick apart</a>.</p><p>He cut a striking figure, framed with his towering stature, bald head, and stern face. Famous for filling the shoes of police officers, elite bodyguards, and heavy hitters, he favored tailored suits or uniforms, lending to his intimidating character. His authoritative tones and piercing gaze demanded one's attention, and his iconic last role was as Charon in John Wick: Chapter 4. Sadly, Reddick recently passed away. To celebrate his life and career, here are the top Lance Reddick movies and TV shows worth watching.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-the-eric-andre-show>10. The Eric Andre Show</h2></span><p>There's no denying that Lance Reddick made an unforgettable performance on <a href=# rel>The Eric Andre Show</a>, a late-night comedy sketch featuring absurdist humor. During the show's second season, Reddick turned up to promote his latest project and was initially dressed casually in jeans and a t-shirt with a blazer. As the conversation continued, however, Reddick became increasingly confused and annoyed with Eric Andre's strange behavior and questions - eventually standing up abruptly, slamming his hand on the host's desk angrily, and taking off.&nbsp;</p><p>Moments later, he reappeared in a Star Trek: The Next Generation costume, like Geordi La Forge, and began chanting, "I wish I were Levar Burton." This outrageous appearance of Reddick has gone down in history and been widely shared over the internet, resurfacing again with the news of his passing as many discovered his ability to be both an iconic dramatic actor and a man with a great sense of humor.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-angel-has-fallen-2019>9. Angel Has Fallen (2019)</h2></span><p>The third installment in the Fallen franchise, Angel Has Fallen, follows Banning, a Secret Service agent, who is wrongly accused of attempting to assassinate President Trumbull. After losing his former boss and mentor, Lynne Jacobs, Mike is replaced by David Gentry—an unrelenting FBI officer. In this action-packed flick, Banning also celebrates the arrival of his daughter, Lynne. This movie indeed adds to Lance Reddick's list of acclaimed films.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-it-s-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-2005-2013>8. It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia (2005-2013)</h2></span><p>Lance Reddick is renowned for his memorable roles and main characters in some of the most beloved TV shows, yet what sets him apart is his one-off guest appearances elsewhere. His starring role in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, particularly one of the least popular episodes from Season 7, “Frank’s Brother,” is arguably one of the best.&nbsp;</p><p>Through flashbacks, it is revealed that Frank (Danny DeVito) and his brother Gino (Jon Polito) share a past with the same woman. Reddick plays Reggie, a jazzy club owner, combining cynical homages to Blaxploitation cinema characters while also being a militant Civil Rights activist. Reddick’s skillful portrayal fully displays the stereotypes of this genre, proving he is an expert at comedic timing. Notably, no matter the scene, Reggie never appears as the same character, thus allowing Reddick to show off his expansive range.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-lost-2004-2010>7. Lost (2004 - 2010)</h2></span><p>The hit TV show, Lost, captivated audiences due to its impressive cast, complex plotlines, and J.J. Abrams' masterful creativity. Reddick portrayed Matthew Abaddon, a mysterious recruiter for Charles Widmore who could move people to wherever they needed to be. He played a crucial role in directing John Locke to take the fateful Oceanic Flight 815 and assembled a secretive science team to explore the Island several times. His menacing aura, coupled with his unwavering resolve, made him an intimidating figure and is one of Lance Reddick's most memorable roles.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-fringe-2008-2013>6. Fringe (2008-2013)</h2></span><p>As Agent Phillip Broyles, Reddick allowed viewers to believe in his no-nonsense authority easily and yet still appreciate his intense fascination with anomalous subjects. His biography remains hidden from the public eye, occasionally allowing for a minor insight into his life, like beating <a href=# rel>President Obama at golf</a>. He's the kind of person whose secrets you'd love to know, but if he ever decides to tell you, it might cost you your life. Plus, he has one of the most spine-chilling laughs ever seen on television.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-the-domestics-2018>5. The Domestics (2018)</h2></span><p>Across the dystopian wasteland of America, tribes have erupted, known for their fighting methods and the garb they wear. The Domestics, a couple including a husband and wife, pursue a journey to seek refuge in a secure outpost. Amid the tempestuous chaos, The Domestics embodies the savage tales of Mad Max and The Purge. Nathan Wood, portrayed by Lance Reddick, is a loving family man and formidable survival specialist. He presents to the couple his expertise and distributes weapons, such as a shotgun, to take down adversaries. An exciting quest of survival horror mixed with some heart-pumping action ensues. This is definitely a must-watch if you're looking for Lance Reddick movies and TV shows.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-the-guest-2014>4. The Guest (2014)</h2></span><p>The Guest is Adam Wingard’s bloody thriller starring Dan Stevens as an ex-military psychopath. It features a gritty gunfight that fully captures the menacing atmosphere. Major Carver, embodied by Reddick, is pushed to the brink of his capabilities to present how formidable a foe he is facing. Outmatched, outgunned, and surrounded, Reddick's major is the ultimate behemoth for Stevens' character to prove the scope of how lethal he is. Befittingly enough, if someone can withstand the might of Reddick, then no one should ever again get in their way.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-corporate-2018-2020>3. Corporate (2018 - 2020)</h2></span><p>Lance Reddick brilliantly plays Christian Deville, the tyrannical CEO of the world's largest corporate company on Comedy Central's Corporate. Matt and Jake are two hapless employees of Hampton Deville. The employees were subject to perpetual torment at the hands of their tyrannical supervisor, valuing success over morality. Reddick probed deep into CEOs and notorious sociopaths, enabling him to craft a character that was much more than just a two-dimensional villain. Instead, they were a nemesis defensible in their own eyes.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-john-wick-franchise-2014-2023>2. John Wick Franchise (2014 - 2023)</h2></span><p>Charon, debonair and discreet, brought beauty to the <a href=# rel>John Wick films</a> in all four installments. Serving loyally at the Continental, the home for gifted assassins, to Winston, Charon usually kept his poise. However, uproar ensued when Wick strode into the Continental, testing even Charon's unconquerable composure. Lance Reddick has excellently portrayed this minute role and imbued it with moments that have become unforgettable. Whether playing out a demanding guest registry or brandishing his trusty shotgun, Charon maintains an air of dignity.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-the-wire-2002-2008>1. The Wire (2002 - 2008)</h2></span><p>The Wire tops the list of Lance Reddick movies and TV shows. Reddick's acting as Cedric Daniels in The Wire was a remarkable performance. Daniels was Lieutenant of the city's narcotics team, renowned for his incorruptibility and fidelity to justice. In a murky world filled with injustice, he shone as a beacon of integrity. His refusal to accept compromise on the truth eventually saw him leave his post. Later on, he resurfaces as a criminal defense attorney. Reddick's compelling screen presence contributed significantly to a character emblematic of righteousness over political or financial gain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoZ5gZFmo5qmk5p6s7HDnaCco12ivLe1xKxkra5dqLWww9JmqZqmm5qx</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
