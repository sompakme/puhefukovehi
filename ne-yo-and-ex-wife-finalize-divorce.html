Also, he'll pay $20,000 for moving expenses, according to a TMZ report of settlement details. In addition, Renay kept one of their four homes in Georgia as a result of this process. However, that's still not all, as Ne-Yo agreed to give his ex-wife another $150,000 check to buy a new car.</p><p>BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 11: Singer Ne-Yo and wife Crystal Renay attend The Ultimate Big Game Experience hosted by Michael Irvin and Ne-Yo at Tatel Beverly Hills on February 11, 2022 in Beverly Hills, California.

Still, these payments add to other monetary support that Ne-Yo must offer to his former partner. For example, the 43-year-old will pay Renay $12,000 a month in child support for their three children together. Also, they agreed to joint custody and Ne-Yo agreed to cover expenses regarding education. Furthermore, the "So Sick" singer will also give his 36-year-old ex $5,000 a month in alimony for the next three years. Overall, these expenses add up to almost $2 million dollars for Ne-Yo.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">However, all this hassle and monetary coverage is understandable given the case's high profile and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">months-long development</a>. Moreover, Renay filed for divorce from the Arkansas-born artist in August of 2022. However, it caught media attention for Renay's public claims that Ne-Yo cheated on her. “To say I’m heartbroken and disgusted is a understatement. To ask me to stay and accept it is absolutely insane,” she <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">expressed</a> as the news broke. “The mentality of a narcissist. I will no longer lie to the public or pretend that this is something it isn’t.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Furthermore, Renay said that Ne-Yo even fathered a child with another woman, who she called "his paramour" in the filing. Still, their history together is longer and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">more complicated</a> than one might expect as an on-and-off-again couple in the 2010s. They married in February 2016, divorced two years later, and remarried in April of last year.
