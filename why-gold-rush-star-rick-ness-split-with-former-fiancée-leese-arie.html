Sadly, that seems to have been an eery foreshadowing of what would lead to their breaking up for good.&nbsp;</p><p>After experiencing a ton of hate from a Facebook fan page dedicated to Ness, Arie clapped back at trolls by pointing out the true extent of his infidelity and revealing that he was <a href=#>a serial cheater</a>. "Ppl make mistakes, but being cheated on over 200, yes — I said two hundred times. ... is NOT A MISTAKE!!" she shared in an Instagram post (via <a href=#>Starcasm</a>). In the same post, she also revealed that she was finally done for good. "Thank you for the good luck, but I don't think it's 'Luck' I need. I already did the best by leaving him forever," she said.&nbsp;</p><p>While she's since made her Instagram account private, at the time of writing, Arie is still active on TikTok — and she's been very open about the cheating there, too. In response to one <a href=#>TikToker</a> asking if they really had broken up, she replied, "Yes, I couldn't do it anymore. You [can't] force someone to treat you right." Replying to another commenter, she made a point of noting that she has to prioritize herself. "I am finally strong enough to do what's best for me," she wrote.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamtkbn55hI6wn7Jll6S5pXnRrqqhZaKesKx5zZ6qrGWcmrK0sYyaqaKdXai9rbXTaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
