He didn’t do anything wrong to me and I blew our interaction out of proportion,” Fernandez wrote.</p><p>“I know many people think that I’m only apologising because I got called out from the video I posted and this is half right.”</p><p>The video – which has since been deleted – showed Fernandez lifting weights and complaining about a man standing behind her.</p><p>“Stupid f***ing piece of sh*t behind me,” said Fernandez into a microphone. “I hate this. I hate this. I hate when there’s weirdos.”</p><p>Fernandez then zoomed in on the alleged “creep” who could be seen nearby and later offered to help her attach a plate to the barbell she was using.</p><p>The video also featured several captions, including, “What if I just ripped his pp out of its socket so he can never reproduce again” and “natural selection better take these weirdos out”.</p><p>Fellow fitness influencer Joey Swoll called her out on it, saying that she “needs to do better”.</p><p>“Women are harassed in gyms and it needs to stop, but you are not one of them. An act of kindness or a glance does not make you a victim,” the caption on Swoll’s video read.</p><p>Swoll suggested in the video that the man was simply trying to help Fernandez because he thought she was struggling with the weight and pointed out that she was in front of him and had her camera facing him.</p><p>“First and foremost, as I’ve said before, there is a big difference between staring at somebody and simply looking or glancing at them,” said Swoll.</p><p>“So why did this man look at you? Well, you’re in front of him, off to the side. You’re in his peripheral. You’re also taking a video with your camera pointed directly at him, and you’re talking to yourself.</p><p>“He’s probably watching you wondering, ‘What is she doing?’ Know I would.”</p><p>Fernandez revealed in her apology that she has been a victim of sexual assault and sexual harassment and that both events have left her “extremely” damaged.</p><p>The influencer also conceded that if she had not been called out, she wouldn’t have had a chance to learn from her mistake.</p><p>“After reading literally thousands of comments about me, the situation and the man in question, it truly opened my eyes to how damaging this could have been for him,” Fernandez said.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“Men and women deal with very different problems in the realm of the opposite sex and after looking through the lens of an innocent man put in a situation like that, it honestly made me feel sick to my stomach with guilt.</p><p>“I think it’s important to call people out on their mistakes and, in the words of Joey, help them ‘do better’. This is exactly what I plan to do with not just my content but my life moving forward.”</p><p><i>This article originally appeared on the <a class=body-link href=# title=nypost.com>New York Post</a> and was reproduced with permission</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme9GemKVlnJ6zpnvNnq6sZZyes6Z7yKedpa2Vo7CmvoyjnKyrmZiubrLEq6WappSax7R5wKmmpaeXrnqistOeqWabkaG5qrrGZqaurF2cxq55wqucnqhfo7K4v4ysq6iqqWR%2Fo4CYcm%2BbaWhlhaKuxWydbm1lmIB4r5Fra2xtaG6upA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
