Case in point? Benjamin Keough. While both his mother and sister, <a href=#>actress and model Riley Keough</a>, have social media accounts, Benjamin doesn't appear to have a social media presence at all, which is probably why we know so little about him. However, while it's clear that Elvis Presley's grandson won't be posting selfies to Instagram anytime soon, his mom's account offers a tease of what it might be like if her son was on social media.</p><p>While Lisa Marie Presley's shot of her kids went viral in June 2019, it actually wasn't the first time she had posted a photo that showed off Benjamin's striking resemblance to his grandfather. A year earlier, she had shared two pictures of her and Benjamin. <a href=#>One showed them backstage together</a> at the Grand Ole Opry in 2012. The other shot, also from 2012, was of <a href=#>the two filming Good Morning America</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While we don't know what he's up to now, we do have some insight into Keough's upbringing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmanFgboJ5e8SlraKrXaW%2Fpr%2FLnrCsZZenrq%2Bw0qilZqSfpLi0ecSxmJysnK56rbXKnmStoJViuaazxKebaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
