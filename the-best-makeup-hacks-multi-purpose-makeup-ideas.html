This is also likely true because we're faced with having to use what we already own — no more spontaneous trips to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sephora</a> or impulse beauty buys while checking out at the drugstore (at least for the time being, anyway).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And makeup artists can relate.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Not only are they also stuck at home — tinkering with their favorite products in unusual, but inventive ways — but having to be innovative and multi-purpose with the products in their kit is just a part of the job.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">That's why we asked eight celebrity makeup artists what their favorite multi-use beauty products are and ways we can use them while we're at home.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">All of their best tricks, ahead.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-daniel-martin></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Daniel Martin</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of Daniel Martin</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Makeup artist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Daniel Martin</a> is a fan of using liquid lipstick not only for the lips, but also as a cheek stain.

"I find that I am more nurturing and minimal in my daily routine and I am taking a break from makeup. I have found that now, more than ever, my olfactory senses really influence my mood. I use Chanel Huile de Jasmin on my face and décolletage daily and using what's left on my hands, I run it through my hair."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The hair holds scent very well and to be gently followed by the scent of Jasmin feels very nurturing," she continues.

"I start at my ear and swipe inwards, stopping halfway on my cheek. This product is so easy to use and can easily be blended out with fingers or any type of semi-firm brush. While I'm at it, and quickly multi-tasking with my makeup, I also love to swipe a bit just above the crease of my eye on my outer brow bone, on the hollow of my temples and the other edges of my forehead, and of course, along my jawline and under my chin.
