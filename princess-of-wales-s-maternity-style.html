On an official visit to a bereavement charity last week, she wore a loose-fitting Peter Pan-collar dress from high-street chain Topshop, which she paired with a cream A-line Redgrave coat.</p><p id=elbldOtaFMU3 data-wc=61>The next day, she attended 150th anniversary celebrations of the London Underground in a teal outfit by Danish fashion label By Malene Birger. But as her tummy grows, she may opt for the loose-fitting styles favoured by Diana. As the world waits to see what Kate's take on maternity style will be, let's take a look back at Diana's pregnancy wardrobe.</p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
