The&nbsp;Married At First Sight&nbsp;crew takes charge as Brennan comforts Emily, who’s visibly shaken. She asked him, “Am I going to be okay?”</p><p>He responded,&nbsp;“You’re gonna be alright,”&nbsp;as he held her hand. Brennan is heard asking crews, “Can you call 911?” before Emily is then rushed to hospital as a result of the ATV accident.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-friend-shuts-down-fake-rumors>Friend shuts down ‘fake’ rumors</h2><p>When viewers claimed the blood “didn’t look real,” Emily’s friend hit back and said, “It was most definitely not staged! I’ve seen the pictures and get chills thinking she needs to relive this horrifying moment.”</p><p>It comes after fans wrote comments like, “I thought the same thing, that looked like lukewarm fake blood 🩸,” and, “I worked urgent care for over 15 years, Is it me or did that blood look hot pink?
