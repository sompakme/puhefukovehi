This is despite reportedly making $300,000 each of the multiple "Teen Mom" seasons in which she has appeared, according to <a href=#>Life & Style</a>. Per Celebrity Net Worth, however, a custody battle with her ex made her "living situation...increasingly difficult" as she struggled to move out of their shared home while moving on romantically with a coworker.</p><p dir=ltr>Kailyn's financial situation may come as a surprise, given that it is shockingly low compared to some of the show's highest-paid alums. Farrah Abraham, for instance, is arguably the show's most recognizable face and worth $1 million in 2021, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. With an extensive post-"Teen Mom" reality TV career, Abraham has appeared on everything from the fourth season of VH1's "Couples Therapy" to "Celebrity Big Brother." She also made her foray into an adult film career, infamously selling a self-made sex tape with porn star James Deen for $1.5 million in 2013 (for which she continued receiving royalties of $600,000 per month at one point).&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>It sounds like the good news is, though, that Kailyn can also keep parlaying that "Teen Mom" rep into more green. Reality TV stars might not have the renown of a film or scripted TV star, but they get offered continuous business opportunities nonetheless!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbHFoZYV0e8qaoKWxnmK5sMPRsqpmppWperi70a2fZqCfrHquwcKhZKKrXam1pnnTnpynZZ2kum5%2BjKyrmqpdrLyzwMdo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
