When LeBron works out, he likes to post videos from his sessions on his Instagram story. LeBron seems to be having a ton of fun when he drops these clips and fans like to make fun of him for his bombastic enthusiasm. On Tuesday though, fans had a much different take on his work out as he dropped a bizarre video of himself doing squats.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">On the surface, squats shouldn't be anything new for an NBA player but the way in which LeBron was doing them was questionable at best. As you can tell from the video below, LeBron is sticking his butt out for everyone to see. While the commenters will surely question me for pointing this out, it's important to note that the entire internet seemed to notice as well.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">James gave all of Twitter a reason to come together and provide some hilarious memes on the matter. If there's one thing we have learned from this situation, it's that people have way too much time on their hands and that you should always do your squats properly.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After this latest bit of roasting, perhaps we'll see LeBron change his technique in the future.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
