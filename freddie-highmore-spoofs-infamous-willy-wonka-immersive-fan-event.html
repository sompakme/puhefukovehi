My name is Charlie Bucket and welcome to my chocolate factory,” Highmore said as a greenscreen behind him fell down, revealing a sparsely decorated building that resembled the now-infamous <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/willy-wonka-event-uk-chocolate-experience-meth-lab-1235837133/>Willy Wonka-themed immersive experience </a>in the U.K. that reportedly left children in tears. “Pretty sweet, huh?” the actor added in the clip.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As Highmore continued the tour with the children, they eventually encountered an Oompa Loompa who offered them “yummy methamphetamine,” which referenced parents who compared the Glasgow fan attraction to a meth lab.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Later in the video, a woman wearing a black cloak and silver mask, whom the actor called the Unknown, jumped out and scared the kids. “I am relieved you see her, too,” Highmore whispered under his breath as he quickly shuffled the children away.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When one of the kids complained that the chocolate factory “doesn’t look like the pictures,” Highmore explained that he created the flyers using the artificial intelligence program ChatGPT — another reference to the <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/willy-wonka-disaster-fan-event-interview-1235838211/>failed fan event earlier this year</a>, where event organizers apparently used AI to generate high-quality promotional images of the experience.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Everything here is created by ChatGPT,” Highmore exclaimed before breaking out into what seemed to be his own AI-generated song. “Candy is good / Candy is mouth / sweet is fun / And we love to imagination!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">When the two children appeared disappointed in their chocolate factory experience, with one even calling it “sad,” Highmore admitted that business hadn’t been doing as well since <a href=# id=auto-tag_willy-wonka_1 data-tag=willy-wonka>Willy Wonka</a> gave him the keys to the kingdom.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I’m gonna level with you kids: The factory never really took off after Wonka gave it to me,” the actor said. “I was 10! I did my best, but I was way in over my head and considering all of that, I’d say, look at this place! I’ve done pretty darn swell.” Photos from the actual controversial U.K. immersive experience were then displayed on the screen.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the end, when Highmore revealed that the children won his chocolate factory, they didn’t seem very amused, with one saying, “Let’s kill him,” as they attacked the actor with plastic prop candy canes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The video concluded with a note that the movie was in “abandoned theaters everywhere.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSnnaeofKe%2BxJ2bop1dnbaotMyoqZ5lo6W8sLLSZp2aoZyasW7DyKWjsmWnpLusrYyfmKdllauyr8CMamlsbWhsfnV%2FlGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
