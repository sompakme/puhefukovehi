The creator of hits including Netflix’s Emily in Paris and TV Land’s Younger has departed his longtime home at Paramount Global’s MTV Entertainment Studios for a rich overall deal with Universal Television. Star has a carveout in his new eight-figure deal and will remain showrunner on Emily in Paris should Netflix continue the show beyond its upcoming fourth season. Beyond that, Star will create and develop new series for NBCUniversal’s broadcast network and streamers as well as for outside platforms."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

TV. Both pacts represent a new wave of overall deals to come after last year’s writers strike.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In the post-Peak TV era of contraction, overall deals have become harder to come by and the price tag — even for prolific producers — has come down considerably. Star had signed back-to-back deals with Chris McCarthy’s MTV Entertainment Studios, with his last pact a companywide one with Paramount Global. Emily in Paris was originally developed for TV Land but was sold to Netflix after the basic cable network exited the scripted originals business. It remains the streaming giant’s top half-hour comedy. His other recent show, Netflix’s <a href=# id=auto-tag_uncoupled_1 data-tag=uncoupled>Uncoupled</a>, was canceled after one season, only for Paramount’s Showtime — now overseen by Chris McCarthy — to rescue it before eventually dropping it.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Star is repped by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue9OvZq2uXaOyuL%2BOnZirqpWjerTAwKtknrCZqcBuvMCrmKanpaPBbsHNoq2eqqOWuW7A1WabnpmcYn5zf5RxbWprYmx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
