His Netflix series&nbsp;Down to Earth with Zac Efron&nbsp;took him to&nbsp;different places around the world to learn how we find inspiration from their sustainable and eco-friendly ways of living.</p><h2 id=how-did-zac-and-vanessa-meet-3>How did Zac and Vanessa meet?</h2><p>While it sounds like something out of fanfiction, Valladares met Efron back in June while she was waiting tables at Byron Bay's General Store café. "Zac met Ness earlier in the summer. They started hanging out in July and recently took a ski trip together," a source told&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/movies/zac-efron-vanessa-valladares-brunch-australia/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>PEOPLE</a>.

Also per the&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-8702255/Zac-Efron-rumoured-new-girlfriend-Vanessa-Valladares-jet-Byron-Bay-budget-airline.html referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Daily Mail</a>,&nbsp;Valladares reportedly moved in with Efron at his Belongil Beach home, which he's renting, in the fall of 2020. He tried to buy a home in Bryon Bay but was beat out by another buyer at the last minute.</p><p>Efron had previously voiced his need to leave L.A. behind. In promoting&nbsp;Down to Earth with Zac Efron, he explained he wanted a change of scenery. "I gotta get out of Hollywood, I'm done. It's not a place conducive to living a long, happy, mentally-sound life," he said. At the Australian premiere for&nbsp;Baywatch&nbsp;in 2017, Efron said, "I've fallen in love with Australia and the fans out here, the people, the culture, the beach. I've come out for most of my premieres, every chance I had the opportunity to. [I've] made great friends over the years here. I kind of sneak over here on my own time as well."</p><h2 id=is-zac-moving-to-australia-3>Is Zac moving to Australia?</h2><p>A source told&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/movies/zac-efron-house-hunting-byron-bay-australia/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;in September, "It really seems he plans on staying in Australia permanently." Could it be because of Valladares?

They've posted similar photos from time to time, which makes the private investigator in me assume the said photographer of the photo would be each other. For example: Efron&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CExLD9hFrSV referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>posted this photo</a>&nbsp;of him in a hammock, and Valladares&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CDSjEt2pywb referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>posted a similar photo</a>&nbsp;collection of her enjoying the ocean on July 30.</p><p>Per&nbsp;<a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://people.com/movies/zac-efron-vanessa-valladares-hold-hands-in-australia/ referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>PEOPLE</a>, Valladares celebrated with Efron for his 33rd birthday in October, and the pair were spotted again in December in Adelaide and January in Sydney.

"Zac and Vanessa looked like the real deal," a source told&nbsp;The Sun. "They were besotted with each other. So once he decided to stay in Australia long term, he suggested they buy their first home. They'd started to look at a few places but, sadly, fate wasn't on their side.
