For the most part, she has continued the drill sound that she established on "Munch." However, now that she has built up quite a few connections in the industry, some believe she should take more sonic risks. Whether or not she takes that advice, remains to be seen.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As for this weekend, Spice was seen <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">alongside none other than Quavo at a bowling alley. </a>While at the alley, Ice Spice could be seen wearing a jersey of sorts with some booty shorts. Meanwhile, in a recent Instagram photo dump, she showcased her bowling prowess. Unfortunately, she ended up throwing a gutter ball. However, one could make the argument that she was simply distracted by her own music video which was playing on the screen above the pins.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-ice-spice-at-the-bowling-alley>Ice Spice At The Bowling Alley</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Luckily for Ice Spice, her bowling skills, or lack thereof, have no bearing on how her upcoming album is going to perform. Instead, it's going to hinge on her ability to craft great songs and secure massive features. Only time will tell whether or not she gives us a third single prior to the album's release. "Gimmie A Light" proved to be a divisive single, and it appears as though fans are expecting a bit more from her.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of Ice Spice and her bowling skills, in the comments section down below.
