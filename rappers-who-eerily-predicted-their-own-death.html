The "Lucid Dreams" crooner didn't shy away from his battle with addiction, and in 2019 on the <a href=#>No Jumper</a> podcast, he spoke about first being introduced to drugs. "It was something that I was into early, lowkey, due to music, 'cause I was a music head, so like in sixth grade, seventh grade, I'm hearing songs about sipping lean," said Juice Wrld, mentioning the drink made of cough syrup, Sprite, and, at times, hard candy, referenced by a lot of rappers in songs. Juice Wrld also named Atlanta rapper Future as someone who influenced him to experiment with drugs, telling the podcast host that his music made him want to "sip lean at, like, 11, 12 years old."</p><p>Juice Wrld also referenced his drug problem in his music, on songs like "Lean Wit Me," "Different," and, <a href=#>"Legends."</a> "What's the 27 club?/We ain't making it past 21/I been going through paranoia/So I always gotta keep a gun," he sings on "Legends," referencing the group of artists who've died at age 27, like Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain, Jimi Hendrix, and Amy Winehouse.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGlian5xe9Gap6mdoqh6uLTOZpyeqpmhxm680Z6bopukmrFuwMeeoKtln6y7brDEmquhZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
