Most people know about crucifixion from the story of Jesus Christ, but according to <a href=#>Britannica</a> the practice existed long before Christ's time, <a href=#>dating back to about the sixth&nbsp;century BC</a>.</p><p>Christ on the cross is one of the most famous examples of crucifixion, however, and many artists choose to depict Christ in a beatific, peaceful manner. There are only four relatively small wounds involved, after all, and while hanging on a cross for hours doesn't seem pleasant, it also may not seem particularly painful — but it is. It's so painful, in fact, that, as noted by <a href=#>Azusa Pacific University</a>, the word "excruciating" actually derives from "crucifixion."</p><p><a href=#>Forbes</a> notes that most depictions of crucifixion get the details wrong. The nails don't go through the palms, but through the wrists, which would feel like "lightning going through your middle and ring fingers" while hitting the median nerve, making your hands contract in agony. A similar strategy is employed on the feet, with the end result that breathing becomes difficult and painful. And while this torture is going on, insects may be gnawing away at the wounds, causing even more pain.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkmtpb25fqbWmecyoqq1loJa2r7LUpWSwmamoerW7jJ2gnmWRmLCwvsOipaBlpKR6tK%2FInqWcnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
