After <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">catching strays</a> on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Kendrick Lamar</a>'s verse on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a>'s "Like That," he unleashed his fourth mixtape in April, Might Delete Later. The project arrived complete with a scathing response, "7 Minute Drill." Shortly after unveiling it, however, J Cole backtracked and removed the song from all streaming services. He also issued a formal apology to Kendrick onstage at his Dreamville fest. This was a controversial move until the Compton MC went nuclear on <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a> amid their lyrical battle.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Shortly after that debacle blew over, he joined forces with Cash Cobain for "Grippy." His feature was far from well-received, however, and he was immediately ripped to shreds for what listeners called "cringe" bars. He managed to redeem himself with his fan-favorite appearance on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">"Free Fall"</a> from Tems' new album, and now, he's gearing up to unveil yet another high-profile collab.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-j-cole-amp-tee-grizzley-have-new-music-on-the-way>J Cole & Tee Grizzley Have New Music On The Way</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Earlier this week, the North Carolina-born performer was spotted filming what appears to be a new music video alongside Tee Grizzley. In a clip from the exciting moment, the two artists are seen spitting in the streets of NYC. The video is expected to accompany a new track they have on the way, which does not yet have an official name. It doesn't have a release date either. The fact that they're already working on a video, however, indicates that it should arrive <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">sooner rather than later.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of J Cole linking up with Tee Grizzley to film an <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">upcoming music video</a> in New York City? Are you surprised or not? Are you looking forward to seeing it? Who do you want to see J Cole collaborate with next?
