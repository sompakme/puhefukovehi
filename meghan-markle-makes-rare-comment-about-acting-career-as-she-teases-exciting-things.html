While she had “no idea” what caused the renewed interest, the&nbsp;Duchess of Sussex&nbsp;offered a theory.</p><p id=eZPqWkojymC data-wc=70>“It was great to work on, such a great cast and crew. We had a really fun time. I was on it for seven seasons, so quite a bit”, she observed, in reference to her role as paralegal Rachel Zane. “But it’s hard to find a show you can binge-watch that many episodes of these days, so that could have something to do with it. But good shows are everlasting.”</p><p id=eH25NpYtjU data-wc=55>Meghan retired from when she got engaged to Prince Harry in 2018. The show itself aired for nine seasons from 2011 to 2019. While she is no longer an actress, she has taken on the role of a producer through the couple’s company Archewell Productions, where they develop TV and film projects with Netflix.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cf79815a1335-gettyimages-1665180907.jpg><p id=eE6E1rm6PT data-wc=34>The Sussexes have debuted three projects: the documentary Heart of Invictus, the docuseries Live to Lead, and the autobiographical project Harry & Meghan - and it appears there is more to come from Archwell.&nbsp;</p><p id=eeo17H6ETvT data-wc=38>“We have so many exciting things on the slate”, the actress-turned-activist said. “I can’t wait until we can announce them, but I’m just really proud of what we’re creating. My husband is loving it, too. It’s really fun.”</p><p id=eCXnwIfxW1A data-wc=45>When asked what inspired their new projects, Meghan looked pensive as she reflected that it was: “Things that make people feel – I was going say ‘good,’ but it’s more than that, things that make people feel something, right? And feel a sense of community.”&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Meghan Markle nails quiet luxury in stunning off-the-shoulder caramel dress at star-studded gala" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b14c50617d8b-meghan-markle-posing.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Meghan Markle nails quiet luxury in stunning off-the-shoulder caramel dress at star-studded gala" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Meghan Markle nails quiet luxury in stunning off-the-shoulder caramel dress at star-studded gala</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e5OB58MAoY data-wc=18>The former actress was previously honored at&nbsp;’s&nbsp;Power of Women, making her an ‘alumni’ of the event.</p><p id=eOZ5MJIx4YE data-wc=34>“This industry is just so special and you see how many women use the platform that they have and just channel it for good”, she observed, particularly praising the blend of philanthropy and entertainment.</p><p id=es4PYd8edsT data-wc=23>“I’m just thrilled to be back in it”, she said, “to be able to sit in this room in such good company tonight.”</p><p id=eaupLIA8htp data-wc=6><strong></strong><br></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
