actresses Charlotte Gainsbourg, playwright Sir Christopher Hampton and former French tennis player Amélie Mauresmo.</p><p>As the guests mingled before sitting down to eat, Sir Mick was locked in

had given the President a complete edition of French author Voltaire’s writings - a volume that included his Lettres sur les Anglais which were once banned in France and may – or may not – have been a wry comment on free speech.</p><p>In return, Mr Macron gave the King a golden coin from the Monnaie de Paris featuring Charles’s image.</p><p>He also gave him a first-edition prize-winning French novel – Romain Gary’s novel Les Racines du Ciel (The Roots of Heaven), which won the Prix Goncourt, France’s highest literary award in 1956.</p><p>After a 40-minute tete-a-tete at the Elysee, the two heads of state strolled down the road to the British ambassador’s residence to shouts from onlookers of “vive le roi”.</p><p>The King pointed to the crowds, and the two men looked at each other and said: “Shall we say hello?” – which they duly did.</p><p>One woman in the crowd, who shook hands with the King and gave her name as Sophie, from Lyon,&nbsp;said: “I came here to see the King and because I think it’s an important and memorable moment for our two countries, especially since Brexit.</p><p>“For my part, it was in some sense also a tribute to Queen Elizabeth.”</p><p>She added: “People here still have an affection for the British crown.”</p><p>At the residence, the King and Mr Macron planted an oak sapling – a gift from the president to mark their warm friendship – following a long tradition begun by the late Queen.</p><p>If any doubts remained about the rapport between the two men, he also gave his French counterpart a photograph album containing images of the two of them.</p><p>As he raised his glass at the banquet, the King said: “ I would like, if you would allow me, to raise a toast to President and Madame Macron and to the French people, as well as to our Entente Cordiale - a sustainable alliance. &nbsp;Whatever lies ahead, may it endure, faithful and constant, for centuries to come.”</p><a class=live-post__wrapper-body-timestamp id=1695237869216
