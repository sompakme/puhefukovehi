Of course, he would end up winning the match as well.</p><p>While speaking during a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dale Earnhardt Jr</a>., Cody Rhodes claimed that he has signed more photos of his torn pec than anything else.</p><p>“It’s one of the strangest audience reactions I’ve ever had,” Rhodes said. “I didn’t know, would they think this is cool? Really what it came across was, we don’t know how to feel about this. Talking about myself, he seems like he’s very injured, half of my body at that point. It was a complete tear, thing was ripped to shreds. And that bruise just kept getting bigger and bigger and it was running down. I thought I might have some other problems in my bicep and stuff because it was just getting bigger and bigger. I cramped up too, so it’s ripped off from here, but it’s still hanging up here, and all of a sudden it shot up real high. It looked like I had a giant chest.</p><p>Lots of fans approached me to autograph photos of my torn pec. I think I’ve signed photos of my torn pec more than anything else.”</p><p>We will have to wait and see what WWE has planned for Cody Rhodes in the coming weeks, as fans want him to be utilized to the best of his abilities.</p><p>What’s your view on what Cody Rhodes said?
