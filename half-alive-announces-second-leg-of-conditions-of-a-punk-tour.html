Over the course of the next year, they crafted what became their massive breakout single “still feel.” which has been RIAA certified Gold, rocketed into the Top 10 at Alt Radio and has over 276 million worldwide streams to date. The video organically surpassed the 10 million mark within two months as the song garnered acclaim from NPR’s coveted “All Songs Considered” and more. The trio sold out their formal debut headlining tour in 2019 which included two sold out shows at The Fonda Theatre in LA. The tour also included stops at major music festivals including Lollapalooza, Outside Lands and Bumbershoot. Later that year, the band made their late-night television debut with a very special performance of “still feel.” on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. Check out the incredible and unique performance<a href=# data-rel=lightbox-video-0>HERE</a>. They also performed “RUNAWAY” on The Late Late Show with James Corden.&nbsp;</p><p>In August 2019, they released their debut album&nbsp;Now, Not Yet&nbsp;which has amassed over 611 million worldwide streams to date. half•alive was named YouTube’s Artist on the Rise and their live Vevo DSCVR performances of “RUNAWAY” and “arrow” plus their NPR&nbsp;<a href=#>Tiny Desk Concert</a>&nbsp;showcase their incredible creative artistry. NPR called them&nbsp;“…a band with a clear vision and gift for design, not just in the earworms they write, but in their entire presentation, with often-matching outfits and carefully selected color schemes.”&nbsp;In 2020, half•alive released their EP&nbsp;in Florescence, an audio and visual project that included orchestral arrangements of four tracks off their critically acclaimed debut album&nbsp;Now, Not Yet&nbsp;as well as videos for three of the four songs to accompany them. Last year, the band shared their EP&nbsp;Give Me Your Shoulders, Pt. 1&nbsp;featuring “Move Me” which was most added at Alt Radio around its launch and “What’s Wrong” which has garnered over 23.8 million streams worldwide. The band also performed “What’s Wrong” on Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The band recently released their sophomore albumConditions Of A Punk&nbsp;featuring “Did I Make You Up?” which reached Top 10 at Alt Radio. Earlier this year, they embarked on their UK, Europe and North America ‘Conditions Of A Punk’ headline and are ready to hit the road again this fall for their second leg.</p><p><a href=#>Twitter</a>&nbsp;//&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;//&nbsp;<a href=#>YouTube</a>&nbsp;//&nbsp;<a href=#>Website</a>&nbsp;//&nbsp;<a href=#>TikTok</a></p><p><strong>About Live Nation Entertainment<br></strong>Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE: LYV) is the world’s leading live entertainment company comprised of global market leaders: Ticketmaster, Live Nation Concerts, and Live Nation Sponsorship.
