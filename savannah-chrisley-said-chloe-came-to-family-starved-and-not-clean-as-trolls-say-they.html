So for Chloe’s birthday, I posted that kind of video of all those photos…”</p><p>She was referring to an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a> post which she captioned: “I’m so blessed that God chose me to be your sister Coco! I love you so much sweet girl… I can’t believe you are TEN! 10! WHAT?! Where did all the time go…please stop growing up… HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!”</p><p>Many people commented on the post to say to Savannah that she is <a href=#>not Chloe’s sister</a>.</p><p>Savannah responded to the commenters on her podcast episode that in her eyes, she and Chloe are sisters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-are-savannah-and-chloe-related>How are Savannah and Chloe related?</h2><p>During the November 29 episode, <a href=#>Julie Chrisley</a> said: “Yes, she has biological parents. But, every child that has been adopted has biological parents.</p><p>“That doesn’t mean that we aren’t her parents. She has been adopted. She is ours, she is not our granddaughter.”</p><p>Julie added: “She is our daughter, which makes her your sister.”</p><p>Savannah also said that the <a href=#>Chrisleys</a> have had Chloe since she was under a year old. She added that they’ve “been there for every part of her life.”</p><p>The 25-year-old added: “This child came to us from her biological mother and she had been starved half the time, she wasn’t clean. She came to us one time with a burn on her chest and we had to take her to the pediatrician. All of these things were documented.”</p><p>Julie added that it’s more important how Chloe sees Savannah and the <a href=#>rest of her family</a>. The Chrisley Knows Best star said that Chloe refers to Savannah, Chase, and Grayson as her siblings.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Savannah Faith Chrisley (@savannahchrisley)</a></p></figure>View Instagram Post<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=savannahs-post-about-chloes-birthday>Savannah’s post about Chloe’s birthday</h2><p>When it comes to where the comments came from in regard to Savannah and Chloe’s relationship, it was Savannah’s November 10 Instagram post.</p><p>One of the comments on the post that Savannah read out on her podcast was: “Honestly, I realize that you all love this precious angel but you are not her sister, you’re her Aunt. Your mother is not her mother, she is her grandmother. She has a mother, although not fit and a father apparently not fit either but they made her and are her biological parents.”</p><p>Others were kind in their comments, writing: “I love the way your family loves her. Happy Birthday Princess!”</p><p>Savannah also added in her response to the people commenting on her post that Chloe naturally began calling <a href=#>Todd Chrisley</a> “dad”.</p><p>Savannah said: “Ya’ll spoke to child psychologists, therapists and dad would correct her and be like ‘no, papa’.”</p><p>The Unlocked podcast founder continued that child psychologists advised the Chrisleys not to correct Chloe and that they said: “…whatever she identifies with, that’s what you are.”</p><p>Chloe was also legally adopted by <a href=#>Todd and Julie Chrisley</a> and Savannah added that there was an “adoption ceremony.”</p><p>Julie concluded that family can look many different ways. Savannah said that family is more about “how you love each other” and “how people show up for you.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>AND GET FREAKY WITH US ON </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>INSTAGRAM</a><strong>, </strong><a href=# rel=nofollow>FACEBOOK</a>, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TWITTER</a> AND <a href=# rel=nofollow>TIKTOK</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7HApaCtsaSewaO102eaqKVfqsCiedGemKWhpK56tcKOrJivmZ6jrql5wqGpoqucmsZuv8Cim2abmKG8pnnCmqSeZaSkeqetzKKjsmWjqa6zwsSdZJqmlGK7sMCMnKOemZ5irrR506umpaSjYsCixYytn56xopp6r7vTZqqiq6Sav7Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
