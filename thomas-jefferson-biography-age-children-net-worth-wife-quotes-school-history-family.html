He grew up with nine siblings,&nbsp;<strong>Peter Field Jefferson</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Elizabeth Jefferson</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Anna Scott Jefferson Marks</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Lucy Jefferson Lewis</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Martha Jefferson Carr</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Mary Jefferson Bolling</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Peter Thomas Jefferson</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Randolph Jefferson</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Jane Jefferson</strong>.</p><p><strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong>‘s educational journey began at&nbsp;William & Mary College&nbsp;on March 25, 1760, when he was just 16. Before that, he had the privilege of learning from private tutors at home and attending schools run by Anglican clergymen. By the time he arrived in Williamsburg, young&nbsp;<strong>Jefferson&nbsp;</strong>was already well-versed in the classics and had a talent for reading Greek and Latin authors in their original languages, a passion he pursued throughout his life.</p><p>At&nbsp;William & Mary,&nbsp;<strong>Jefferson&nbsp;</strong>found himself immersed in a vibrant academic community. Alongside the philosophy school where he was enrolled, the college offered a grammar school for younger boys, a divinity school for those preparing for church ministry, and even an Indian School focused on educating and Christianizing young Native American boys.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong>, one of the esteemed United States Founding Fathers, wore many hats in the early government. He kicked off as the nation’s first Secretary of State under President&nbsp;<strong>George Washington</strong>, then slid into second Vice President under&nbsp;<strong>John Adams</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1801, he clinched the presidency, snagging the 3rd President of the United States title, a gig he rocked for two back-to-back terms until 1809. Alongside his political hustle,&nbsp;<strong>Jefferson&nbsp;</strong>dabbled in shaping America’s foreign affairs, especially during his stint as the U.S. Minister to France, where he played a key role in fortifying the friendship between the two nations during a crucial period.</p><p>Now, despite&nbsp;<strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong>‘s impressive resume and hand in molding the nation, let’s not gloss over his flaws. Yep, he was a slave owner, and he didn’t shy away from some pretty prejudiced views, which kind of clashed with his whole spiel about liberty and equality.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus, his track record with Native Americans wasn’t stellar either, showing a bit of a blind spot when it came to their rights and sovereignty. So, while we tip our hats to his achievements, it’s only fair to acknowledge and learn from the not-so-great parts of his story.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong>‘s first marriage to&nbsp;<strong>Martha Jefferson</strong>&nbsp;was happy, but sadly, she passed away at a young age in 1781. While there is speculation about other romantic relationships in Jefferson’s life, none have been officially confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this,&nbsp;<strong>Jefferson&nbsp;</strong>remained devoted to his family and had six children with&nbsp;<strong>Martha</strong>:&nbsp;<strong>Martha Jefferson Randolph</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Madison Hemings</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Harriet Hemings</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Eston Hemings</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Beverly Hemings</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Mary Jefferson Eppes</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Lucy Elizabeth Jefferson</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Lucy Elizabeth Jefferson I</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Jane Jefferson</strong>. However, only four survived to adulthood.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Net_Worth></span>Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Thomas Jefferson</strong>, the third President of the United States, was one of the wealthiest presidents in history. His net worth, primarily derived from land ownership and the ownership of slaves, peaked at around $284 million in today’s dollars.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite his wealth,&nbsp;<strong>Jefferson&nbsp;</strong>was a strong advocate for democracy and equality for all, and he even struggled with debt towards the end of his life due to poor financial management.</p><h5>NOTICE!!
