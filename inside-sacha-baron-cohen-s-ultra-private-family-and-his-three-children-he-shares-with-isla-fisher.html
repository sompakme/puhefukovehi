It's about giving our children the space and freedom to just be kids, away from the public eye," Isla explained.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_7LZ_EWjxK data-wc=56>She further elaborated on the delicate balance of raising children in today's digital age, "We're navigating parenting in a social media landscape, which means being even more vigilant about their privacy. Our children deserve a normal childhood — the kind where they can play outside, free from the pressures and scrutiny that come with public exposure."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bd48fd56e479-isla-fisher-sacha-baron-cohen.jpg><p id=eXVIzslRWEs data-wc=22>Balancing demanding careers with family time is a nuanced dance for Isla and Sacha, who endeavor to create a nurturing home environment.&nbsp;</p><p id=eaGchVXHgv0 data-wc=76>Reflecting on this challenge, Isla offered a glimpse into her philosophy, drawing parallels to her work. "Finding that perfect balance between work and family is an ongoing challenge. There's no magic formula, but as I often say, echoing the sentiments of my book's character, 'Don’t worry about being perfect; it’s the fun that counts!' This mantra helps keep things in perspective when the juggle of life and work feels overwhelming," she shared with the Daily Mail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2875e2ec8a11-isla-fisher-husband-sacha-baron-cohen.jpg><p id=eUOww5L9_xO data-wc=35>The narrative of their family life began to unfold in 2007 with the birth of their first daughter, marking the start of their parenting journey, followed by the arrivals of another daughter and a son.</p><p id=ezVcY0JcB9L data-wc=43>These milestones have been shared sparingly, respecting their strong stance on privacy. The family's decision to relocate to Australia during the pandemic was a move towards grounding themselves in Isla's heritage and providing their children with a semblance of normalcy in tumultuous times.</p><p id=e5-2dU0r4SF data-wc=52>Reflecting on her Australian roots and the decision to move, Isla revealed to Marie Claire Australia, "There’s something inherently magical about being home in Australia. It’s where I can truly be myself, surrounded by the warmth of the people and the natural beauty. It’s a nurturing place for our children to experience."</p><p id=evealZLgjZn data-wc=60>Yet, the pull of professional responsibilities eventually led them back to the U.S. "As much as our hearts are with Australia, our lives are here in the U.S. now. It’s not just about me anymore; I have a family to think about, and it’s important to stay connected and grounded as a unit," Isla confided to The Australian’s Women Weekly.</p><p id=ethP7h4npX3 data-wc=24>Isla's days are filled with the typical parental duties of homework help and school runs, where she brings a touch of humor and humility.&nbsp;</p><p id=enFf3Tjn_HE data-wc=34>"You might find me grappling with fourth-grade math homework, but I’m also the one in sweatpants at school drop-off, embracing the chaos and simplicity of everyday parenting," she joked in an interview with PEOPLE.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/133c688fc20c-sacha-baron-cohen-1b.jpg><p id=e63HW2ZdFvB data-wc=60>Her acting talents shine through in her storytelling, where bedtime becomes a stage for creativity and connection. "Telling stories is our special thing. It’s when I get to use all these silly voices and characters, much to my kids' delight. It's one of the perks of my job that I love bringing home," Isla shared with The Australian’s Women Weekly.</p><p id=eVMCpW6SAfP data-wc=22>Beyond the joy of storytelling, Isla's writing ventures, including the beloved Marge and Mazy series, often involve her children as creative collaborators.&nbsp;</p><p id=e-8l8_TllE_D data-wc=28>"My children are my toughest critics and my most creative co-conspirators. Their feedback is invaluable, and it’s these moments of shared creativity that bring us closer," she revealed.</p><p id=eAx1omI6iRKr data-wc=57>Despite her cool public persona, Isla is grounded in her identity as a mother, always striving to impress her most discerning audience — her children. "Being 'cool' in the eyes of my kids is the ultimate compliment, but at the end of the day, it's about being present, authentic, and loving," she expressed to the Daily Mail.</p><p id=e58KMklj2ZUr data-wc=32><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
