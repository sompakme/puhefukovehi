Gen Z have discovered the joys of a long, uninterrupted nap - but predictably they’ve taken it to the next level.

My bed, hotel bed, beach sand, hammock etc. I was made to lay and rot.”</p><p>Another described the trend as their “passion” and “hobby”.</p><p>“Me watching this while laying in bed everyday for the past two weeks Never felt so alive,” another wrote.</p><p>Some even take it to the next level and get ready for a day in bed with a makeup and outfit routine.</p><p>It follows the “everything shower” trend on social media, meaning a shower routine that can last hours with countless products and music playing.</p><p>One influencer said: “An everything shower with hot water and Taylor Swift is better than sex. Sorry.”</p><p>In a TikTok video, she described her routine: “I wash my hair, shave my legs, shave my armpits, deep condition, exfoliate, do my skincare. I do everything in the shower.”</p><p>Her “everything shower” only takes place once a month, but many do it more often.</p><p>Dermatologist Dr Lindsey Zubritsky explained that there was a right way to do an “everything shower”, and it has to do with the order of your routine.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>She recommends starting with washing your hair because if you wait too long to rinse out your conditioner, it can sit on your skin and cause back acne.</p><p>Next you should exfoliate, before shaving with gel to lower your risk of irritation. After washing off the shaving gel, she suggested double cleansing your face as part of your skincare routine.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmpaGWmsC1xcueZrCgkal6qr%2BMm5ydZaKkwbW1zaBkp52nYsGzsc2dZKCdnmLHbrXSZqabq5WowKawjLCgraBdmsWxuMCipZ6cX3mVhY6ofox7eoZ3jpOSrImPbo92bKOZl7OOZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
