Of course, this was an incredibly successful movie at the time, and people still hold the original in high-regard, even if the sequels were underwhelming.
During a recent interview with self-help guru Tony Robbins, Tyson spoke about his role in The Hangover and how he didn't even know what was going on."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Tyson has had his fair share of film roles over the years, with many looking towards his contributions in&nbsp;The Hangover,&nbsp;as his best work. Of course, this was an incredibly successful movie at the time, and people still hold the original in high-regard, even if the sequels were underwhelming.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During a recent interview with self-help guru Tony Robbins, Tyson spoke about his role in The Hangover and how he didn't even know what was going on. As he explains, he was drinking and doing a lot of drugs at the time, which ultimately led to him not even knowing he was supposed to be in the movie.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I met the guys in a club, they were in the VIP section and I said, ‘This is where I normally sit, nobody’s normally here,'" Tyson recalled.&nbsp;“So I went in there, I’m checking these guys to see what they’re doing in my section. It was Zach, the other guy, and he said, ‘We’re going to be in a movie with you’ and I said, ‘Yeah? When?’ And he said, ‘Tomorrow.'&nbsp;And I didn’t know as I was drinking and smoking back then, doing drugs so I didn’t know I was involved in the movie. So eventually I had to go and do the movie and it was a success.“</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Despite all of this, things worked out in the end for Tyson and the cast, so he shouldn't feel too badly. On the plus side, Tyson has cleaned up quite a bit since then and has been thriving. In fact, he might be making a comeback to the boxing ring.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
