He eventually gives up that way of life, but she soldiers on. The movie played as the only American entry in the Critics Week sidebar at the Cannes Film Festival that year.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“There are so many levels to her personality,” she said of her character in a 2000 <a rel=nofollow href=#>Temple of Schlock </a>interview. “She’s such a collection of contradictions. Playing that part was very rewarding.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Clark portrayed a government agent in the <a href=#>Jim Brown</a>-starring Slaughter (1972) and Muff, the leader of an all-female Black gang aiming to derail murderous drug dealers, in Switchblade Sisters (1975), directed by Jack Hill.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">She then recurred as Janet Lawson, the love interest of Demond Wilson’s character, on six episodes of NBC’s Sanford and Son from 1976-77.

She loved fashion, food and acting. Her large, full laugh that could fill a room will be missed. She leaves behind friends and family that will forever be grateful for her grace, love and beautiful heart.
