These days, Snitsky looks mostly like he did when he started in WWE, meaning he grew his hair, beard, and eyebrows back."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But he acts totally differently, no more so than when he served as a pitchman for the Power Pressure Cooker XL in 2014. Yes, that's real: He went on YouTube and taught us how to use the XL to make delicious buffalo wings and surf-n-turf on one, easy-to-use pot. In addition, he's been using his size in more apropos ways, like bodyguarding. In 2013, <a href=#>according to CBS Local</a>, Snitsky was serving as a member of Yankees legend Alex Rodriguez's security team. When a 6'8" behemoth warns fans, as he did when speaking to Pennlive.com, "Hopefully for the fans' sake, they stay in the stands. Because if they don't, there could be a problem. Not for me, but for them. So my advice would be: stay in the stands, 'cause if not, you might get hurt," people take him seriously, no matter how nice he seems off the clock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCFj2twameimsGqvsSdZLCqlajBrbHRrGScp52luabAxKWwZq2ep7Kku8anoLOZkqGybsDOnZiyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
