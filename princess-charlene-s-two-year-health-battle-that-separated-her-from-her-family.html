Charlene's doing really well. As you can see for yourself, she's been active in any number of different events. Charlene's engaging more in public life and looking after things that she's passionate about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/88e378d68260-princess-charlene-birthday-z.jpg><p id=e39KrG4AiTBE data-wc=8><strong>Princess Charlene returned to public life in 2022</strong></p><p id=e5oSlv33THI3 data-wc=31>"She's really enjoying doing things together and with the kids, so this year is ending on a very, a very high note. We're truly thrilled about how things are," he continued.</p><p id=eXNfxGwEkBqH data-wc=33>Referring to his wife's health, Albert added: "Last year was a very tough year for her — and the beginning of this year. And she's really turned it around in an incredible way."</p><h2><strong>What illness did Princess Charlene have?</strong></h2><p id=e8MvC38_LiPB data-wc=26>Princess Charlene collapsed on 1 September 2020 due to complications following one of several surgeries for a severe and ongoing ear, nose and throat (ENT) infection.</p><p id=euAeHSYN-qGG data-wc=44>She was rushed to Netcare Alberlito Hospital, and the Palace released the following statement to People: "On the night of September 1, Her Serene Highness Princess Charlene of Monaco was taken to hospital after becoming ill due to complications from a serious ENT infection.</p><p id=euoyI7OV1B0S data-wc=35>"Her Highness is being closely followed by her medical team, who say her condition is reassuring."

Prince Albert confirmed in late October 2021 that she would be heading home to Monaco and their two children soon.</p><p id=e-bzfGkSMYHZ data-wc=48>"She is much better," he told French publication Point de Vue. "This last operation which concerned the nasal septum went very well. We will be able to consider her return very soon. And I can tell you that she will be in Monaco long before the national holiday."</p><p id=ehUi4nPvLoxg data-wc=17>Following her ENT infection, Charlene suffered a bout of exhaustion, which she recovered from away from home.</p><p id=eT2lHraoLm84 data-wc=1><strong>READ: <a class=hm-link href=#>Why Prince Albert and Princess Charlene's attendance at King Charles' coronation is unexpected</a></strong></p><p id=eGziuNHCFVqE data-wc=53>"I can say she was suffering incredible fatigue," Prince Albert told People. "She hadn't slept well in a number of days and she wasn't eating at all well. She has lost a lot of weight, which made her vulnerable to other potential ailments. A cold or the flu or God help us, Covid."</p><p id=eOmB2UztLDPP data-wc=55>He also dismissed further speculation about Charlene's health, telling the magazine: "Because I know there are rumours out there, let me say: This is not Covid. And it's not cancer-related. It's not a personal relationship issue. And if you want to discuss another speculation, it isn't related to plastic surgery or facial work at all."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BemZyptW6tzZ1kn6Gko7K0v45rZ2trYGZ%2FdX2Va2xuaV%2Blv6q6wp6qrGWTna6zuMSnnGaln6OupLuMoZyapKSdeqOt062jnmWUmsGitcusZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
