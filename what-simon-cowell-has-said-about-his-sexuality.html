Per <a href=#>The Independent</a>, Cowell's legal team said that Varney's allegations had led to "widespread media coverage of untrue claims regarding his private life." They continued, "In 2014, the question of whether someone is or is not gay is antiquated (As it happens, he isn't, though if he were, he would simply have said so)." Cowell's attorneys said they felt obliged to respond because Cowell "is renowned for his honesty and candidness," and Varey's comments made it appear as if Cowell had "not been truthful in the public arena."</p><p>Per the <a href=#>BBC</a>, Varey later apologized for the comments he made to Mazher Mahmood, the infamous tabloid sting operator, the "Fake Sheik," who was digging to get dirt on Contostavlos. Varey said he was "clearly very drunk" and had no clue why he'd said Cowell was gay. "This is not true. I do not know why I said it, but assume it is because I was so drunk and felt that I was giving Mahmood the type of information he was seeking," he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxlaoJ1g46wn5qsXai2rrvNZpqor5WhuW6%2FwKKbZpmSpMK1eceiqmarla3CorjIrbBo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
