And at the end of the day the vocalist is not afraid to admit that his, shall we say manly side always gets the best of him.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Witchcraft</h3><p>So that is the actual “witchcraft” the vocalist is speaking to.&nbsp;He’s in a physical relationship with someone which, from a moralistic perspective, he perceives as wrong.&nbsp;But ultimately she is so effective, as in he is so attracted to her that he gives into her seductions nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>So presuming this is a reflection of Frank Sinatra’s real life, even though he didn’t write the song, the interpretation would be that some of the women he&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bonked along the way</a>&nbsp;seduced him as opposed to vice versa – which is very much credible considering the&nbsp;stature of his celebrity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Witchcraft-by-Frank-Sinatra-Lyrics.jpg><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Who wrote “Witchcraft”?</h3><p>This song was written by Carolyn Leigh (lyricist, 1926-1983) and Cy Coleman (composer, 1929-2004).&nbsp;And it originally came out as a single in 1957.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Frank Sinatra records “Witchcraft”</h3><p>Frank Sinatra (1915-1998) actually recorded and released&nbsp;“Witchcraft”&nbsp;three different times. The first, as aforementioned, was as a standalone single.&nbsp;That is also the version that can be found on&nbsp;“All the Way”, a compilation album Ol’ Blue Eyes put out in 1961.&nbsp;</p>');var c=function(){cf.showAsyncAd(opts)};if(typeof window.cf !== 'undefined')c();else{cf_async=!0;var r=document.createElement("script"),s=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];r.async=!0;r.src="//srv.tunefindforfans.com/fruits/apricots.js";r.readyState?r.onreadystatechange=function(){if("loaded"==r.readyState||"complete"==r.readyState)r.onreadystatechange=null,c()}:r.onload=c;s.parentNode.insertBefore(r,s)}; })();<p>Then the second recording is found on an album he dropped in 1963 entitled&nbsp;“Sinatra’s Sinatra”.&nbsp;And finally, near the twilight of his career (and life) Frank released an album called&nbsp;“Duets”&nbsp;(1993) which, as its name implies, features him collaborating with other vocalists.&nbsp;And in regards to&nbsp;“Witchcraft”, he teamed up with classic soul singer Anita Baker.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Frank Sinatra</h3><p>Frank Sinatra was one of the greatest entertainers of his era, being proficient in both singing and acting.&nbsp;Indeed back in those days Hollywood was a bit more like Bollywood, and it was common for actors to be able to lay down a track or two (and vice versa). But he was definitely more of a singer than an actor.&nbsp;</p><p>And in terms of how successful he was, if you were to go to Wikipedia’s current listing of the best<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">-selling music artists</a>&nbsp;in history, with a career that dated back to 1935, Frank Sinatra is actually the oldest name on the list.&nbsp;Moreover he is all the way up in the second tier, having sold approximately 150,000,000 records.&nbsp;</p><p>So it’s not likely that he’ll be knocked off anytime soon.&nbsp;And in terms of record sales, Sinatra is in fact the most-successful artist whose career was relegated exclusively to the 20th&nbsp;century.</p><p>Accordingly Sinatra scored many a hit during his day, with&nbsp;“Witchcraft”&nbsp;being amongst them.&nbsp;For instance, it made it onto the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100.&nbsp;And it was also nominated for&nbsp;<a href=#>Song of the Year</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Record of the Year</a>&nbsp;at the 1959 Grammy Awards, which by the way was the first year the Grammys were ever held. (Both of those awards went to a song by Domenico Modugno named&nbsp;“Nel Blue Dipinto di Blu (Volare)”).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.songmeaningsandfacts.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Witchcraft-by-Frank-Sinatra.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Popular Covers of “Witchcrafts”</h3><p>“Witchcraft”&nbsp;has also been covered by other mid-20th&nbsp;century musical greats such as Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby, Peggy Lee and the King himself, <a href=#>Elvis Presley</a>, whose 1963 rendition&nbsp;was a mild hit.</p><p>The original&nbsp;“Witchcraft”&nbsp;was produced by Dave Cavanaugh (1919-1981), who served as both an A&R and producer at Capitol Records.&nbsp; And it was in fact Capitol that put this track out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tLvNoKSemZ6eu6i%2FwKebn5mTqcBvr86mZp%2BqkaO4br%2FIp5itqpGoeri105yfnKqRm8FuuNiroJyrXaKyorrIp55o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
