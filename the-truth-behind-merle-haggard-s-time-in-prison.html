He also won a Grammy&nbsp;Lifetime Achievement Award, and inductions into both the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and <a href=#>the Country Music Hall of Fame</a>. Bob Dylan called him "herculean," according to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, while <a href=#>Willie Nelson</a> considered him "one of the best." Not bad for an ex-con. Sadly, after a bout with double pneumonia, Haggard <a href=#>died on his 79th birthday</a>, April 6, 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9mGxwa2pfqbWmedOrrK2gXZeyqbXNnWSmnaKhsm60wKCemqqUqHq1tcyeZKKmXaW%2Fqr%2FOp2Y%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
