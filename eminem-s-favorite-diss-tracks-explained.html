Scroll down to learn a bit of hip-hop history.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What'd you think of Eminem's list? Sound off in the comments.</p><p><h6><span>David M. Benett/Dave Benett/Getty Images for Rag & Bone</span></h6><h2><strong>12. Boogie Down Productions – “The Bridge Is Over” (1987)</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Among the earliest disses on this list, this beef involved two rap crews arguing over the birthplace of hip-hop(!). with Boogie Down Productions, representing the Bronx, effectively taking Queensbridge MC Shan's "The Bridge” and scribbling all over it. KRS-One had enough smoke for the entire Juice Crew, including Marley Marl, BDK and Roxanne Shante, and was savage enough to go for their Puma sneakers.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2><strong>11. Roxanne Shanté &nbsp;– “Roxanne’s Revenge” (1984)</strong></h2></p><p><h6><span>David Corio/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images</span></h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Entirely improvised and recorded at the age of 14, Roxanne Shante was the Queen of the Juice Crew. She wound up with a major hit on her hands in the form of "Roxanne's Revenge," which itself was made in response to UTFO's "Roxanne, Roxanne." "Roxanne, Roxanne," a B-side record, was a song about a girl who wasn’t feeling any of the dudes trying to hit her up. Roxanne adopted UTFO's female character and doled out&nbsp;a response to UTFO. She became one of the first extremely popular female MCs at the time with this record.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2><strong>10. MC Lyte – “10% Diss” (1988)</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>As the story goes, friends of MC Lyte, including producer Milk Dee and Audio Two, were pissed that female rapper Antoinette’s debut single “I Got An Attitude” sounded somewhat similar to the famed "Top Billin" -- an Audio Two single with production from Milk Dee. The two parties didn't want to diss a female, so they asked Lyte to do it, and evidently, she was up for it. She responded with the huge “10% Dis,” named as such because MC Lyte <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">claimed the song </a>only contained ten percent of what she could&nbsp;have said about Antoinette. The resulting diss sparked a back-and-forth between the two rappers, including songs such as "Lights Out, Party Over," before MC Lyte responded with "Shut The Eff Up! (Hoe)" and effectively ended it.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2><strong>9. LL Cool J – “Jack The Ripper” (1989)</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Pay close attention to the cover to Kool Moe Dee’s </span><span>How Ya Like Me Now? </span><span>and you can spot LL Cool J's Kangol caught under the front of the Jeep. Kool Moe was upset at LL for a couple of reasons, ones which sound all-too-familiar: he not only felt LL had stolen his style, he thought that LL was disrespectful of the hip-hop&nbsp;OGs to come before him. The two rappers had a feud that was only just starting to spill onto on wax and “Jack The Ripper” was the boiling point, where LL clearly saw fit to defend himself, likening himself to the infamous Jack the Ripper and calling Kool Moe Dee washed up.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2><strong>8. N.W.A – “Fuck The Police” (1988)</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/urbanlinx.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/userfiles/00/48/454800_fb1490a6ebdb3708adc4eaff3ab5c5bb.jpg><p><h6>Raymond Boyd/Getty Images</h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>A song all too relevant today, thirty years after the release of </span><span>Straight Outta Compton </span><span>(though Eminem did try his best to convince Paul Rosenberg and DJ Whoo Kid the diss was actually about the band The Police). The iconic N.W.A record about police brutality and injustice, “Fuck The Police,” sparked outrage after its release. Disapproval for the newly-named "World's Most Dangerous Group" led all the way up to the FBI. Their criticism of the song was soon used by N.W.A. as free publicity, as they sold over three million copies of </span><span>Straight Outta Compton </span><span>with little-to-no airplay.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">&nbsp;</p><h2><strong><span><strong>7. <a href=# class=text-word>Ice Cube</a> – “No Vaseline”</strong>&nbsp;<strong>(1991)</strong></span><span><br></span></strong></h2><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>After Ice Cube left N.W.A. over unpaid royalties, his former bandmates saw fit to take shots while he took the high road. It wasn’t until <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Dr. Dre</a> called Cube a “Benedict Arnold” that he saw fit to respond with the venomous “No Vaseline,” effectively breaking up N.W.A because how can you respond to something like “Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off/ Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft.”</span><span><br></span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span></span></p><p><h2><strong>6. Dr. Dre – “Fuck Wit Dre Day (And Everybody’s Celebrating)” (1992)</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>The day Dre (and Snoop Dogg) got back at everyone: Eazy-E, former manager Jerry Heller, rappers Tim Dog, 2 Live Crew’s Luke and even Ice Cube weren’t safe from the smoke. In the end, Dre had the last laugh as the song ended up charting #8 on the Billboard charts and </span><span>The Chronic, </span><span>the first album he recorded while under Death Row, quickly went triple platinum.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span></span></p><p><h2><strong>5. Tim Dog – “Fuck Compton” (1991)</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Frustrated at all the attention&nbsp;adorning West Coast rap music, and N.W.A. in particular, Bronx rapper Tim Dog let loose upon an entire city with "Fuck Compton." "Come to New York and we'll see who gets robbed," rapped Tim Dog, indirectly sparking the East Coast-West Coast wars that would&nbsp;kick off only a few years later.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><h2><strong>4. <a href=# class=text-word>Common</a> – “The Bitch In Yoo” (1996)</strong></h2><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Ice Cube took offense to certain lines in Common’s “I Used to Love H.E.R.,” which seemed to blame the West Coast with the decline of rap. He fired back with choice disses in “Westside <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Slaughterhouse</a>.” But, Ice Cube clearly underestimated Common because he fired back with “The Bich In Yoo,” which tore apart Cube’s credentials, recent music and even dared to end it by quoting Cube’s own lyrics back at him. The Ice Cube-Common beef was bad enough it required Louis Farrakhan to squash it. Years later, the two starred together in a Barbershop sequel, so who really won out in the end?</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span></span></p><p><h2><strong>3. Eazy-E – “Real Muthaphuckkin Gs” (1993)</strong></h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Eazy-E had the best voice in N.W.A., and he used it to lay waste upon Dre and Snoop Dogg in “Real Muthaphuckkin Gs.” From improving upon Dre’s G-Funk production, to insulting both of them for signing with Death Row and questioning Dre’s past, getting a portion of his royalties was simply the icing upon Eazy’s cake.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>2. YZ – “Diss Fe Liar” (1994)</h2></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Both YZ and hip-hop group Poor Righteous Teachers were signed by Diversity Records, a label YZ happened to be part owner of. Conflicts and a fight over reels would soon force PRT off Diversity, and when YZ later heard their work (produced by Tony D, who also made beats for YZ), he laid two verses aimed directly at their leader Wise Intelligent for daring to step to him.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><h2><strong>1. <a href=# class=text-word>2Pac</a> – "Hit ‘Em Up" (1996)</strong></h2><p><h6><span>Tim Mosenfelder/ImageDirect/Getty Images</span></h6></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>“Hit ‘Em Up” is still a tough diss to forget. Listening to it now, you can hear Tupac step over the proverbial line and wander into murky territory as he went after Biggie, Diddy and an entire East Coast-- causing even more tension between the two coasts.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>“That, I feel like, was the first time I ever heard anybody get that personal on a disc,” Eminem said during the Shade 45 broadcast. “Most of it, the majority was personal, below the belt jabs and shit. But it was done so well and the record was so crazy.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhbX10fZBmnKahnpq6tHnFmq2oqpmpsm6wyKyqZqyilrCsv4yer6mkkZ67prCMp5ywqw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
