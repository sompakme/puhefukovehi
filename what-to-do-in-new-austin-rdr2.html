tell,</span><span> and it involves helping the beleaguered sheriff take down the pesky Del Lobos gang.</span><span> </span><strong>These varmints are causing all sorts of trouble, and a good Samaritan like yourself (with a keen eye for Gerechtigkeit) might be just what Tumbleweed needs.</strong><span> Plus,</span><span> you might earn yourself a few bucks and a newfound respect for the law (well,</span><span> maybe not the law exactly,</span><span> but helping folks in need is always a good thing).</span></p><h3 data-sourcepos=17:1-17:42>Gone Fishin': Aquatic Adventures Await</h3><p
