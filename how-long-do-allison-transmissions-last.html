Not to bad. Or more if taken care of like Toypuller said switch it to a TES-295 rated synthetic fluid and change the external filter regularly and it will last forever.<h2>How reliable are Allison transmissions?</h2>Allison fully automatic transmissions (“Allison Automatics”) have a global reputation for quality, reliability and durability because we engineer and build them to last. That's why Allison Automatic-equipped vehicles have been shown to cost less to operate than comparable competitively-equipped vehicles.<h2>How many miles will Duramax last?</h2>If you want to know how long a Duramax engine will run, you should expect it to last as much as 300,000 miles before needing any major repairs. But, of course, this number can vary depending on how well the engine was maintained and driven throughout its life.<h2>Should I buy a diesel with 200k miles?</h2>As for what's considered high mileage for specific diesel engines? According to Prosource Diesel, anything over 350,000-miles is considered high mileage for a used diesel pickup with a Cummins or Duramax engine under its hood. Anything over 350,000-miles is also regarded as high mileage for a Powerstroke diesel engine.<h2>Diesel Insights: Allison 1000 Transmission</h2><p></p><h2>Is 200k miles alot for a Duramax?</h2>Even when used extensively for towing and hauling, Powerstroke, Cummins and Duramax diesel trucks typically last well beyond 100,000 miles. Because of that, it's not uncommon to see diesel pickups with 200,000 and even 300,000 miles commanding good resale values on the used truck market.<h2>Is the Allison 2000 a good transmission?</h2>the 2000 series is a nice transmission, its still run in many of the newest busses. in most cases it will be limited to 5 speed, however allison can unl;ock the 6th gear if you need a taller over-drive gear... the 2000 series is a nice transmission, its still run in many of the newest busses.<h2>How strong is the Allison 1000?</h2>Initially the Allison 1000 was a 5 speed transmission, rated to handle up to 620 lb⋅ft (840 N⋅m) of torque. This rating has increased as the transmission was updated several times, to stand at 765 lb⋅ft (1,037 N⋅m) by 2011 in GM truck applications.<h2>How much does an Allison 1000 transmission weigh?</h2>* The Allison 1000 uses a modular case design. * The Allison 1000 is rated for a 5,000-rpm input shaft speed capability. * The approximate dry weight of the transmission is 330 pounds with the PTO gear.<h2>When should I service my Allison Transmission?</h2>The typical fluid change interval for a motorhome equipped with a 3000 or 4000 series Allison transmission filled with TES 295 is 300,000 miles or 48 months; for a coach using non-TES 295 fluids, the interval is 25,000 miles or 12 months.<h2>What year did Chevy start using the Allison Transmission?</h2>Production of the Allison LCT 1000 began in 1999. One of the most advanced features found in the Allison 1000 is its use of adaptive learning technology.<h2>Why is it called an Allison Transmission?</h2>Allison began in 1909 when James A.

But regular maintenance (fluid changes, body upkeep, hard part care) will help you have a very long relationship with your truck.<h2>How reliable is the 6.6 Duramax?</h2>As the original Duramax model, the LB7 is still extremely popular with diesel enthusiasts due to its lack of emissions control parts. In general, it's a very durable and reliable engine. However, as the first models hit the 100,000-mile mark, some issues cropped up.<h2>How much horsepower can a stock Allison 1000 handle?</h2>As you've probably deduced up to this point, the stock Allison will handle roughly 350 to 400-rwhp in five-speed form and 425 to 450-rwhp in six-speed trim. However, if you push things past that point the clutches will eventually slip and bring on the Allison's notorious “limp mode” condition (i.e. limp home mode).<h2>Who owns the Allison Transmission?</h2>Purchased by The Carlyle Group and Onex Corp. General Motors Corp. announced on June 28 it will sell its Allison Transmission commercial and military business to The Carlyle Group and Onex Corp.<h2>Did Dodge ever have Allison Transmission?</h2>Dodge offered three basic transmission designs behind the Cummins equipped light duty 2500/3500 pickup trucks from 2003 to 2021.

They have some different internal hard parts.<h2>How much does it cost to rebuild a Duramax diesel?</h2>Depending on on the rebuilder, a Duramax engine replacement is going to cost at least $15,000.
