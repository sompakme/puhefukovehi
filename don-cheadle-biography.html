"I like variety, that's why I wanted to be an actor," he says. "To wear a bunch of different people, and to be in a bunch of different things. That's one of the best things about being an actor."</p><p id=eYGeXBL0cKbz data-wc=40>Bringing an intensity and laid-back charisma to his roles, Don strives to complement rather than overshadow co-stars. That hasn't prevented him distinguishing himself, however, in such star-studded box-office hits such as <i>Boogie Nights</i>, <i>Traffic</i> and both instalments of <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Don Cheadle's early life</h2><p id=e_mAMgn3-BN data-wc=63>Born on November 29, 1964, in Kansas City, Don grew up in Denver, Colorado, the son of a psychologist father and bank manager mother. At the age of five he was already demonstrating an interest in performing, and, with the support and encouragement of his parents, had won scholarships from both music and acting schools by the time he graduated from high school.</p><p id=e9rloOX1ng data-wc=24>Following his acting muse, he attended the prestigious California Institute of the Arts, from which he graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts.&nbsp;</p><h2>Don Cheadle's career</h2><p id=eCAvZWhSsa data-wc=52>After settling in Los Angeles he threw himself into auditions, finally landing a recurring part on the Eighties' TV dance school drama <i>Fame</i>. This led to roles in John Irvin's Vietnam feature <i>Hamburger Hill</i> and a high-profile role opposite Hollywood heavyweights Robert Duvall and <a aria-label="Biography of Sean Penn" class=hm-link href=#>Sean Penn</a> in the Dennis Hopper- directed <i>Colors</i>.&nbsp;</p><p id=eHO08AANQOe data-wc=58>While lead roles eluded him in film, Don continued to hone his acting chops as a guest star on TV series ranging from <i>Hill Street Blues</i> to <i>Night Court.</i> But it was a two-year stint as district attorney John Littleton on <i>Picket Fences</i>, along with his big screen performance opposite Denzel, which won over critics and audiences alike.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLiumiz44Mr data-wc=62>1997 was a big year for Don. He co-starred in three high-profile productions: <i>Volcano</i> with <a aria-label="Biography of Tommy Lee Jones" class=hm-link href=#>Tommy Lee Jones</a>; the award-winning <i>Boogie Nights;</i> and most importantly, John Singleton's <i>Rosewood</i>. His powerful portrayal of Sylvester Carrier, a spirited black resident who reprimands white men for their treatment of black women, left many industry insiders bemused when he was skipped over for an Oscar nomination.&nbsp;</p><p id=expSpYLVOs0 data-wc=61>Since then the actor has scooped his share of awards. He took home a Golden Globe for his performance as Sammy Davis Jr in the made-for-TV production . Then, in 2004, he was recognised by the Academy for his gripping portrayal in of a hotel manager who aided thousands of Tutsi refugees during the 1994 Rwandan genocide.&nbsp;</p><p id=en2NOdD6HVr data-wc=55>Although increasingly at home in big-budget productions, Don slips effortlessly between box office hits such as and smaller indie efforts. "I want to do both," he explains. "I'll make money on those that hit a main stream audience while doing others that don't pay anything but are ones I really care about."</p><p id=e2Iu0cfhEzX data-wc=23>The actor has gone on to have success in the franchise and Marvel, where he plays War Machine in&nbsp;</p><h2>Don Cheadle's personal life</h2><p id=eqaCyAFPnDo data-wc=42><i>Rosewood</i> had greater significance to Don than the controversy it provoked over its failure to deliver an Academy Award nod, however. It was while lensing the flick that he met his current partner, actress Bridgid Coulter, with whom he has two daughters.&nbsp;</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_l1bj44ck>More Profiles</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9saWNksbC6jJyfnpmUobJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
