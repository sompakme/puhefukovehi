Their stories come from four different dynasties and for centuries epitomized the Chinese ideals of beauty, similar to <a href=#>Helen of Troy</a>. Also like Helen, three of the Four Beauties, two of which were concubines, brought down a kingdom. One of them, Xi Shi, sometime referred to as the most physically beautiful of them all, was actually <a href=#>sent by a rival king</a> as revenge.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there was King You, the last king of the Western <a href=#>Zhou dynasty</a> (1046-771 BCE), <a href=#>according to China Knowledge</a>, in no small part because he dropped his current wife and son for another woman. Bao Si was of surpassing beauty but never smiled. The only thing the king could do to make her smile was repeatedly light the signal towers warning the kingdom of invasion. This predictably aggravated his allies so, when an invasion did happen, King You was left to his fate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9mHJpbXFfqbWmedOrmKChk2K1qr%2FTqKmyZZ%2BbeqS0yKecrJ1dmrqxsdGoqaxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
