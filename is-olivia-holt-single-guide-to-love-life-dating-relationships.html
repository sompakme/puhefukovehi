I’m on cloud nine.”</p><p></p><p>Eventually, Olivia and Ray went their separate ways, but the actress seems to be happier than ever with Tony.

I’ve learned from so many incredible talented songwriters and artists, and worked with so many awesome producers … Now I feel more prepared than ever to put out music and I feel so confident about the music that I’ve been making.”</p><p>When it comes to her love life, music and acting career, <a href=#>Olivia sure has come a long way</a> since her days as a Disney Channel darling.
