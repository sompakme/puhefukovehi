"And I realized that it wasn't happening the way that I had pictured it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">So in order to escape the misery, Light had to make a switch. And she's now sharing how she found her grounding and turned her work into a joyful career. Part of what keeps her focused and present is practicing meditation. "It's the moment of stopping, to get yourself into the now," she explains. On this week's podcast, Light says more about how meditating helped her film the upcoming movie, The Menu, in which she stars alongside <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Anya Taylor-Joy</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-judith-light-didnt-dress-herself-until-she-was-27-then-didnt-know-what-to-wear-episode-47-november-16-2021></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Judith Light Didn't Dress Herself Until She Was 27, Then Didn't Know What To Wear: Episode 47: November 16, 2021</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This podcast may contain cursing that would not be appropriate for listeners under 14. Discretion is advised.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Another way she remains happy in her work to this day is so simple, it seems obvious: gratitude. While she notes that publicity can be a challenging part of the job, it just comes with the territory.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You often hear celebrities complain about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>red carpets</a>, press, or fame, but Light takes it all in stride. "Red carpets are what they are — you have to get dressed, get your hair and makeup [done], and you have to get out there. It matters to the people who watch you."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Later in the podcast, she expands on the mutually beneficial relationship actors have with the press, saying she is thankful for the platform that allows her to speak out on topics that are important to her, something she's been doing since the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s when Light became a voice for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>LGBTQA+ community</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She continued, "In the middle of the word, courage, is the word rage, which I find really poignant and powerful, and you could see that the LGBTQIA+ community was stalwart, and present, and out there. And to me, that was inspiring."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the episode, Light touches more on how that inspiration and her friends in the community pushed her to fight through the fear to become one of the first celebrities to advocate for the queer community, which earned her the Isabelle Stevenson Tony Honor in 2019 for her service.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During her abundant career (which is still in full bloom, with the aforementioned, forthcoming film, as well as numerous Ryan Murphy projects like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Impeachment: American Crime Story</a> and The Politician) Light learned quickly that this industry doesn't cater to those who only think of themselves.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"A lot of people want to be a star. They don't want to be a worker, be an artist. They want to be a celebrity," she told Brown. "You think it's about you. It's not about you. And if you try to make it about you, you will be very, very unhappy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Listen to Light's episode on Ladies First with Laura Brown to hear more about her meditation practice, positive attitude, and why she didn't buy her own clothes until age 27.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Listen to the full episode and subscribe on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Apple</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayerFM</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Spotify</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="noreferrer noopener">Stitcher</a>, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Amazon Music</a>, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.
