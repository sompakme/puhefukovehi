The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star shared photos on Instagram of herself debuting a Parisian-style bob, and credited hairstylist César DeLeön Ramirêz for working his magic. César went into detail about how he created Khloe's hairstyle, and explained that it was actually a faux micro bob, meaning the star didn't even have to cut her hair. He wrote: "Khloe – meaning blooming. Loved creating this Parisian-inspired micro bob on @khloekardashian for Oscars night. Check out my stories to see how we did this faux micro bob using @unite_hair." Khloe's famous sisters loved her look as much as she did, with <a class=hm-link href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> writing in the comments: "This hair is everything," while <a class=hm-link href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a> added: "My gorgeous date!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/106fe60388e3-khloe-kardashian-hair-transformation-bob-z.jpg><p id=e8i28FLGaXLp data-wc=9><strong>Khloe Kardashian debuted a faux bob for the Oscars</strong></p><p id=elrKqfXHR88k data-wc=132>Last week, Khloe had asked her followers on social media whether they thought she should dye her hair bronde – a mix of blonde and brunette – after she tried out hair extensions in that particular shade. The majority of her fans agreed that she should go for it and change her hair colour, but after arriving at the Oscars with a peroxide blonde bob, the star has had second thoughts. "I love this hair! I think I'm meant to be a blonde. No more bronde," she wrote. Khloe's Oscars look certainly turned heads throughout the evening, and the star had a wonderful time at Beyoncé and Jay-Z's afterparty, which was held at Chateau Marmont in LA. Other famous faces in attendance at the event included Adele, Jessica Alba and Charlize Theron.</p><p id=e8QCjMmglfbN data-wc=1><strong>MORE:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Selena Gomez showcases caramel-coloured curls in stunning new photo</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d5c5425ce80a-khloe-kardashian-hair-extension-wardrobe-z.jpg><p id=emZh51jaLGBO data-wc=14><strong>The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star has a wardrobe dedicated to hair extensions</strong></p><p id=eu8Q_OuVlVW- data-wc=1><strong>READ:</strong> <a class=hm-link href=#>Kim Kardashian updates fans after daughter Chicago's fall</a></p><p id=ewaG753eKOt7 data-wc=135>The 35-year-old recently showcased another new look at her niece Stormi's second birthday party. Khloe embraced her natural waves for a voluminous 'do, and shared a short video of herself on Instagram, writing: "My natural curl is trying to come out and play." She also tagged her hair stylist, Jen Atkin. The mother-of-one has an entire wardrobe dedicated to her hair extensions, and recently gave fans a glimpse inside the impressive space. Khloe's wardrobe was filled with different hairpieces that were clipped onto hangers and displayed via colour. A photo shared on Instagram showed two rails filled with pink and auburn hairpieces, as well as wig stands to display a selection of different styles. Khloe has been working with The Home Edit to help her organise her house, which is exceptionally organised as a result.</p><p id=e1QJuRB9Tzdm data-wc=14><strong>Like this story?<a class=hm-link href=#> Sign up to our newsletter</a> to get other stories like this delivered straight to your inbox.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F%2Bj2lpamloaYNxfI6kn6WnlWK4or7DmqqhoZGjeqmtyKtkraqRo8Cnu9GmmK2hn6N6uLXToaaurF2YwrXAyKeeZqCVp3qprcirZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
