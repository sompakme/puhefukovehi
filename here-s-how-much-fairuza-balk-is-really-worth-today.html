With dark hair, darker makeup, and an overall '90s goth girl image, Balk cast a spell over audiences back in the day. According to IMDB, the young actress was chosen &#34;from 1,200 girls to star as Dorothy&#34; in 1985's Return to Oz, marking her first major role."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

According to <a href=#>IMDB</a>, the young actress was chosen "from 1,200 girls to star as Dorothy" in 1985's&nbsp;Return to Oz,&nbsp;marking her first major role. But 10 years later, it would be another film that magically turned her into a star.&nbsp;Along with Robin Tunney, Rachel True, and <a href=#>Neve Campbell</a>, Balk transfixed fans with 1996's The Craft, which followed a group of female friends with occult powers (think, <a href=#>Elvira: Mistress of the Dark</a> meets...&nbsp;Mean Girls). The film conjured up <a href=#>$24 million globally</a>&nbsp;and she was suddenly famous, as was her scary goth image. The spiked collar? Crucifix earrings? It sort of became her thing, and we're not mad about it.</p><p>Fairuza Balk kept her storm of memorable parts rolling in 1998, with major parts in both&nbsp;American History X and The Waterboy, and with 2000's Almost Famous. Talk about... range! The <a href=#>Adam Sandler-starring</a> football comedy grossed an impressive <a href=#>$148 million worldwide</a>, and Balk proved her versatility. To an extent. Much like JNCO jeans, Fairuza Balk has&nbsp;<a href=#>unfortunately become a relic of the 1990s</a>, most likely due to getting goth typecast. But, again, much like JNCO jeans, a <a href=#>comeback</a> isn't impossible down the road.</p><p dir=ltr>Here's Fairuza Balk's net worth today.&nbsp;</p><h2>Fairuza Balk's net worth is unfortunately low</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/heres-how-much-fairuza-balk-is-really-worth-today/fairuza-balks-net-worth-is-unfortunately-low-1615043705.jpg> <span class=gallery-image-credit>Kevin Winter/Getty Images</span><p>So what is Fairuza Balk's net worth today?&nbsp;Sadly, after her 1990s blockbusters, the actress couldn't keep the momentum going.&nbsp;She <a href=#>appeared</a> in well-reviewed indie films well into the new millennium, but her most significant return since was in 2015 on Showtime's Ray Donovan.&nbsp;She's also appeared in 2020's Paradise City, and The Craft: Legacy. That said, she has still kept busy.&nbsp;Not only is Fairuza Balk a talented singer, but she also sells original artwork <a href=#>on her website</a>. And she seems okay with missing out on fame and fortune.&nbsp;</p><p>"I never just want to work for the sake of working," Balk told <a href=#>Dread Central</a> in 2013. "...I struggled a lot with being pushed too hard in my 20's, with people telling me that I had to keep taking more and more movies because that's really only when I'd be relevant. Hollywood is designed that way; it's always about the new flavor of the moment and I've always preferred to be a bit more mysterious." We love that for her!</p><p>Today, Fairuza Balk is worth $2 million, per <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.&nbsp;According to <a href=#>IMDB</a>, she "lives in Venice, California and has an apartment in New York City," and she seems at peace. In 2019, Balk went on a springtime road trip across America. "All the wild flowers are blooming and it's all so green," she wrote on <a href=#>Twitter</a>.&nbsp;The star may not be the wealthiest, but being a cult movie icon is priceless.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGxpZ4Rze8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnMrpqhZZaWtrPB2Zpkm5mcoHqqv4yrnJqknK56uLvRrZ9mrJ%2BZrrp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
