Bobby Fulton was the first to break the news of Brett Sawyer’s passing. He also paid tribute to Brett’s brother, Mad Dog Buzz Sawyer, who had already passed on. I’m truly saddened to hear of the passing of Brett Wayne Sawyer! He was the brother of Mad Dog Buzz Sawyer, although both are gone the stories will forever live on."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Together, the Sawyer brothers formed a tag team in Don Owens’ Pacific Northwest Wrestling during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Brett adopted the moniker “Hacksaw” during this period and enjoyed a successful career within the Portland territory. He secured the Pacific Northwest title on four occasions and claimed multiple Tag Team championships.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Beyond the Portland wrestling scene, Brett and Buzz engaged in a memorable feud with The Road Warriors, Hawk and Animal, in Georgia Championship Wrestling, vying for the NWA National Tag Team titles. In 1985 and 1986, Brett Sawyer competed in Jim Crockett Promotions, often teaming up with Buzz. Their wrestling journey also took them to New Japan Pro Wrestling in 1987. In the realm of Championship Wrestling from Florida, Sawyer formed a tag team partnership with Jim Backlund, later known as Jimmy Del Rey, under the moniker “The Playboys.” Additionally, he teamed up with Chicky Starr in Southwest Championship Wrestling.</p><p>As a solo competitor, Brett Wayne Sawyer held the Central States Wrestling Championship in Kansas City. During that time, he garnered a fan following on his own to prove himself.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>Although his wrestling career concluded in 1998, Brett had recently begun making appearances at conventions, participating in autograph signings and photo sessions. His presence was felt at events like last month’s The Gathering III in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>We are sending our best to Brett Sawyer’s family, friends, and fans during this sad time.
