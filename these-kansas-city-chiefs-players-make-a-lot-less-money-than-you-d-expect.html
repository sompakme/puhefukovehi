All clocked in at making $660,000 a year.</p><p dir=ltr>Making an annual salary slightly above these guys, but still under a million are 25-year-old linebacker Darius Harris and 23-year-old defensive end Tim Ward, who both are set to earn an annual salary of $695,000. But both players are also under two-year contracts and expected to earn $1,390,000 overall. So unless contracts are renewed or extended, or a player earns a bonus, they can expect the minimum salary.</p><p dir=ltr>Earning slightly more are also 26-year-old wide receiver Chad Williams, who signed a one-year contract worth $920,000, and 23-year-old new recruit and offensive tackler Prince Tega Wanogho with a $780,000 contract.</p><p dir=ltr>It is important to note that most of the lower-paid players are usually acquired on a reserves or futures contract, and are usually on standby for forthcoming seasons before being on the active roster. Then there are other players noted above (Williams and Ward) who are part of the team's practice group.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FkW5ocG5fqbWmv8Rmopqmo5bAbq%2FIrbBmm5iesqe%2FjKmjmrGVp8BuucCknGaZXaG8tXnLnqqsZZ2ku6bFjK2fmqZdrry2sIyer6mdk6l8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
