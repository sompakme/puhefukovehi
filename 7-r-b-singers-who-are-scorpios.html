Scorpios are known to be extremely driven and loyal. Moreover, they have an intensity that pushes them to achieve whatever they’ve set their sights on. This is evidently the case for the singers who were born between October 23 and November 21. From <a href=# class=text-word rel>Ciara</a>’s killer dance moves to Willow Smith’s incredible musical versatility, Scorpios are truly a talented bunch.

Even before she was a teenager, her star power was already discovered. By the mid-90s, Monica became responsible for some seriously iconic R&B hits. She is truly deserving of her flowers, especially given that she paved the way for many prominent singers after her. Owing to her incredibly soothing voice, Monica has explored many other genres, including Hip Hop, Gospel, and even country music.

Over the course of her multi-decade career, she has spawned numerous party and club hits. Her discography is also loaded with chart-topping tracks that have served to cement her legacy.

In an interview with Complex, Mariah the Scientist revealed that her connection to the Scorpio sign is much deeper than most. Additionally, she likened herself to the sign’s scorpion and shared how it inspired her third album, To Be Eaten Alive. “A scorpion, at first glance, it's more meek… You don't really know what it's capable of,” she said. “It can be poisonous and venomous; if you were to eat it, it would kill you. So to be eaten alive is really to kill.” She released the album today, on her 26th birthday.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Frank Ocean (October 28, 1987)</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NEW YORK - SEPTEMBER 13: Frank Ocean attends The 2021 Met Gala Celebrating In America: A Lexicon Of Fashion at Metropolitan Museum of Art on September 13, 2021 in New York City.

On the subject of her single, “Love Galore,” she shared with Genius that she “just be wildin' out," attributing this quality to her sign. "I have a mean streak. And I’m a Scorpio,” she said. “So, it’s like if we go off and really go there to the point where I’m talking crazy, it’s like we’re probably never going to talk to each other again by the time I’m done. Because of me and my mouth.”</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Davido (November 21, 1992)</h2></span><p>NEWARK, NEW JERSEY - SEPTEMBER 12: Davido during the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards at Prudential Center on September 12, 2023 in Newark, New Jersey.
