The FBI has yet to release any statement on the progress of its investigation.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>The hunt for Petito, who was recording the couple’s cross-country adventures on social media, and then the search for Laundrie, captured the nation’s attention. Police in Moab City, Utah, released <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">body-cam footage</a> recorded on 12 August of officers speaking with the couple after receiving a domestic violence call.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In the video, a tearful Petito is seen admitting the pair had fought, with officers eventually separating them for the night, Laundrie going to a hotel. Laundrie is seen telling the officers, who controversially concluded that Petito was the aggressor, that they had “a minor scuffle” and he did not want to pursue a domestic violence charge.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>“I’m not going to pursue anything because she is my fiancee and I love her,” he says. “It was just a squabble. Sorry it had to get so public.”</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>It was the last known recording of Laundrie and Petito together.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>North Port police investigating Laundrie’s disappearance said the family refused to speak with detectives, which Bertolino later said was on his advice. Nobody has been charged in connection with the case.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Laundrie and Petito were childhood sweethearts on Long Island in New York, then moved to Florida in 2019 to live with Laundrie’s parents in North Port, about 34 miles south of Sarasota. They set off on their “van life” trip in July, planning to reach Oregon by Halloween, according to their social media accounts.</p><ul class=dcr-1lpi6p1><li class=dcr-1lpi6p1><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In the US, the <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">National Suicide Prevention Lifeline</a> is at 800-273-8255 and <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">online chat is also available</a>.
