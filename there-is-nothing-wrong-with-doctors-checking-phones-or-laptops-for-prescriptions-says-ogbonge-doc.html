It goes a long way to show that regardless of what you know or who you are, you want to do the right thing for your patients and your ego isn't going to be a barrier. It is not the checking that makes you a doctor neither is it what will make you less of a doctor."<h2>Social media reactions</h2><p class=align-left>Ephraim Herbert said:</p>"Even me,I do search internet most time for correct prescriptions and also for the best and latest drug."<p class=align-left>Usman Isa Hamza said:</p>"I used to think that he's not professional but with these info you shared, it has cleared all doubts."<p class=align-left>Charity Omoarukhe Okolo said:</p>"It has happened to me too, the doctor was just going tru tabs and all that, I was very ok with it."<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b65a653e29710d75.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>35 great mentor quotes that will help inspire and motivate you</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kuyoro Oluwakemi Bukunola said:</p>"That's good to know then.
