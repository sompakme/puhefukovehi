The celebrities noted that half of Gaza’s residents are children, and two-thirds are refugees and their descendants being forced to flee their homes. The letter also pointed out that more than 6,000 bombs have been dropped on Gaza since the Hamas terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, resulting in one child being killed every 15 minutes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Beyond our pain and mourning for all of the people there and their loved ones around the world we are motivated by an unbending will to stand for our common humanity,” it concluded. “We stand for freedom, justice, dignity and peace for all people – and a deep desire to stop more bloodshed.

In response to those attacks, the Israeli government launched a “complete siege” on Gaza.

He said he spoke with the president of the Palestinian Authority and reiterated that the states remain committed to the “Palestinian people’s right to dignity and to self-determination.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“Like so many others, I am heartbroken by the tragic loss of Palestinian life, including the explosion at a hospital in Gaza — which was not done by the Israelis,” <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>Biden said in his primetime remarks</a>. “We mourn every innocent life lost.

Humanitarian aid must be allowed to reach them.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">We believe that the United States can play a vital diplomatic role in ending the suffering and we are adding our voices to those from the US Congress, UNICEF, Doctors without Borders, The International Committee of The Red Cross, and so many others.

To echo UNICEF, “Compassion — and international law — must prevail.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">As of this writing more than 6,000 bombs have been dropped on Gaza in the last 12 days – resulting in one child being killed every 15 minutes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>“Children and families in Gaza have practically run out of food, water, electricity, medicine and safe access to hospitals, following days of air strikes and cuts to all supply routes.
